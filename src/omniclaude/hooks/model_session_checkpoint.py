"""Session-level checkpoint model for limit-aware session continuity.

When Claude Code approaches context, session, or weekly limits, the orchestrator
writes a ``ModelSessionCheckpoint`` to disk so an external watchdog process can
resume work after limits reset.

Checkpoint files live at ``.onex_state/orchestrator/checkpoint.yaml``.

This is distinct from the pipeline-level checkpoint in ``pipeline_checkpoint.py``
which tracks *skill phases*. This module tracks *session limits* and provides
enough state for a cold resume via ``claude -p``.

See Also:
    - ``session_checkpoint_writer.py`` for persistence (OMN-7286)
    - ``statusline_parser.py`` for limit data extraction (OMN-7284)
    - ``limit_threshold_monitor.py`` for threshold evaluation (OMN-7287)
