"""ONEX-compliant event schemas for Claude Code hooks.

This module provides ONEX-compatible event payload models for Claude Code hooks,
following the registration events pattern from omnibase_infra. These models
are designed for event sourcing with proper causation tracking.

IMPORTANT: Timestamp fields (emitted_at) have NO default_factory (no datetime.now()).
This is intentional per ONEX architecture - producers must explicitly inject timestamps.
This ensures:
    - Deterministic testing (fixed time in tests)
    - Consistent ordering (no clock skew between services)
    - Explicit time injection (no hidden time dependencies)

Key Design Decisions:
    - entity_id: Used as partition key for Kafka ordering guarantees.
      For Claude Code hooks, entity_id equals session_id (UUID form).
    - causation_id: Links events in a causal chain. For session.started,
      this may be a synthetic ID; for subsequent events, it references
      the previous event's message_id.
    - correlation_id: Groups all events in a logical workflow for tracing.

Privacy Considerations:
    This module handles potentially sensitive data from user sessions. Key
    privacy-sensitive fields and their handling:

    - **prompt_preview**: User prompt content, truncated to 100 chars and
      automatically sanitized to redact common secret patterns (API keys,
      passwords, tokens). Despite sanitization, treat as potentially sensitive.
      See _sanitize_prompt_preview() and PROMPT_PREVIEW_MAX_LENGTH.

    - **working_directory**: File system path that may reveal usernames,
      project names, or organizational structure. Consider anonymizing in
      aggregated analytics.

    - **git_branch**: Branch names may contain ticket IDs, feature names,
      or developer identifiers. Treat as potentially identifying.

    - **summary** (tool execution): May contain file paths, code snippets,
      or error messages with sensitive data. Limited to 500 chars.

    - **session_id / entity_id**: Tracking identifiers that link user activity.
      Implement appropriate data retention policies.

    Data Retention Recommendations:
        - Raw events: 30-90 days (operational needs)
        - Aggregated metrics: Longer retention acceptable
        - Prompt previews: Shortest possible retention
        - Apply GDPR/CCPA deletion requirements as applicable

    Access Control Recommendations:
        - Limit access to raw events to authorized operators
        - Anonymize data for analytics and ML training
        - Audit access to privacy-sensitive fields

PROMPT_PREVIEW_MAX_LENGTH: int = 100

# Privacy: Patterns that may indicate secrets (compiled for performance)
# These patterns are intentionally simple to avoid false negatives
#
# KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES (intentionally not matched):
#   - Short passwords: "password=short" (less than 8 chars) - not matched to reduce  # pragma: allowlist secret
#     false positives on common non-secret patterns like "password=placeholder"
#   - URL parameters: "reset_password=true" - the boolean "true" is only 4 chars
#     so it won't match the 8+ char requirement
#   - Base64 strings that happen to start with "eyJ" but aren't JWT tokens -
#     we require the full three-part JWT structure to minimize false positives
#
# PATTERN DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
#   1. All patterns are compiled at module load time for O(1) lookup
#   2. Patterns use word boundaries (\b) where appropriate to avoid partial matches
#   3. Minimum length requirements reduce false positives
#   4. Capturing groups (parentheses) are ONLY used when the replacement needs
#      backreferences like \1 or \2. Otherwise, use non-capturing groups (?:...)
#      for alternation.
#
# IMPORTANT: These patterns are designed for use with sub()/subn(), NOT findall().
#   - subn() correctly counts substitutions regardless of capturing groups
#   - findall() with capturing groups returns ONLY captured groups, not full matches,
#     which would cause incorrect counts or unexpected behavior
#   - If you need to count matches without replacing, use sum(1 for _ in pattern.finditer(text))

        - Despite sanitization, treat prompt_preview as potentially containing
          sensitive information - apply appropriate access controls.
        - For maximum security, pre-sanitize prompts before event emission.
        - Implement appropriate data retention policies for events containing
          prompt_preview data.

        length_divergence_ratio: Absolute ratio of length difference to shadow
            length: abs(local_len - shadow_len) / max(shadow_len, 1). Range 0.0+.
            Values > 0.70 indicate significant length divergence (gate threshold).
        keyword_overlap_score: Jaccard similarity of significant word sets
            between local and shadow responses (0.0 = no overlap, 1.0 = identical
            vocabulary). Uses word sets after stop-word removal.
        structural_match: True when both responses have the same top-level
            structural category (e.g., both have code blocks, both are prose).
        quality_gate_passed: True when all comparison metrics are within
            acceptable divergence thresholds.
        divergence_reason: Human-readable explanation of divergence. None only
            when no divergence of any kind occurred (length, keyword, or
            structural). May be non-None even when quality_gate_passed=True
            (e.g., structural mismatch is advisory and does not fail the gate).
        shadow_latency_ms: Wall-clock time for the shadow Claude call in ms.
        sample_rate: The configured sampling rate (0.0-1.0) at which this
            shadow check was triggered.
        consecutive_passing_days: Number of consecutive days where the pass rate
            met or exceeded the exit threshold (for exit criteria tracking).
        exit_threshold: The pass-rate threshold (e.g. 0.95) required to count a
            day toward the exit window.
        exit_window_days: Number of consecutive days above threshold required to
            trigger auto-disable (e.g. 30).
        auto_disable_triggered: True when this run is the last before auto-disable
            fires (consecutive_passing_days + 1 >= exit_window_days).

    Note:
        ``extra="ignore"`` is intentional — the shadow comparison result dict may
        carry additional debug fields not needed by this schema.

# Decision Record Event (OMN-2465)
# =============================================================================


class ModelHookDecisionRecordedPayload(BaseModel):
    """Event payload for the decision-recorded event envelope (evt topic, privacy-safe).

    Emitted on ``onex.evt.omniintelligence.decision-recorded.v1`` (broad access).
    Carries only summary fields — no agent_rationale, no reproducibility_snapshot.
    Full payloads (including sensitive fields) are emitted exclusively on the
    restricted ``onex.cmd.omniintelligence.decision-recorded.v1`` topic.

    Privacy split (OMN-2465):
        - **evt topic** (this model): decision_id, decision_type, selected_candidate,
          candidates_count, has_rationale — safe for broad observability consumers.
        - **cmd topic**: full DecisionRecord including agent_rationale and
          reproducibility_snapshot — restricted to OmniIntelligence service only.

    Attributes:
        decision_id: Unique identifier for this routing/planning decision.
        decision_type: Category of decision (e.g., "agent_routing", "plan_selection").
        selected_candidate: Identifier of the chosen candidate (agent name, plan ID, etc.).
        candidates_count: Total number of candidates that were evaluated.
        has_rationale: True when agent_rationale was captured (full text on cmd topic only).
        emitted_at: Timestamp when the event was emitted (UTC). Explicitly injected —
            no datetime.now() defaults.
        session_id: Optional session identifier for correlation with hook events.

    Time Injection:
        The ``emitted_at`` field has no default value. Callers must explicitly
        inject the timestamp. This is intentional per repo invariant — deterministic
        timestamps enable reproducible tests.

    Privacy:
        This model is safe for ``onex.evt.*`` topics. It MUST NOT contain
        agent_rationale, reproducibility_snapshot, or any field from the full
        DecisionRecord that may include prompt content or system internals.

    Example:
        >>> from datetime import UTC, datetime
        >>> payload = ModelHookDecisionRecordedPayload(
        ...     decision_id="dec-abc123",
        ...     decision_type="agent_routing",
        ...     selected_candidate="polymorphic-agent",
        ...     candidates_count=5,
        ...     has_rationale=True,
