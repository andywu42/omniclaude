"""Channel orchestration handler.

Receives a normalized channel message, processes it through the assistant
pipeline, and returns an orchestrator output with the generated reply.

MVP implementation: echo-style response to prove the pipeline works.
Real LLM integration will be wired in a follow-up ticket.
