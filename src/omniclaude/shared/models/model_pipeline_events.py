"""Wave 2 pipeline observability event models for OMN-2922.

Five new pipeline event types consumed by omnidash Wave 2 projection nodes.

Topics:
    onex.evt.omniclaude.epic-run-updated.v1      (state table, upsert by run_id)
    onex.evt.omniclaude.pr-watch-updated.v1      (state table, upsert by run_id)
    onex.evt.omniclaude.gate-decision.v1         (event table, append-only)
    onex.evt.omniclaude.budget-cap-hit.v1        (state table, upsert by run_id)
    onex.evt.omniclaude.circuit-breaker-tripped.v1 (event table, append-only)

Storage semantics:
    State tables (one row per run_id):
        epic_run_lease        keyed by run_id
        pr_watch_state        keyed by run_id
        pipeline_budget_state keyed by run_id
    Event tables (append-only):
        gate_decisions        keyed by gate_id
        circuit_breaker_events keyed by event_id

Modeled after ModelSkillStartedEvent at model_skill_lifecycle_events.py:27-52.
All models use frozen=True, extra="ignore". emitted_at is explicitly injected
by the emitter (never auto-populated at deserialization time).
