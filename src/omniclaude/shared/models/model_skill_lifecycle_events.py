"""Skill lifecycle event models for OMN-2773.

Emitted by handle_skill_requested() on every skill invocation.
``run_id`` is the join key: started and completed for the same invocation
share the same ``run_id`` and are guaranteed to land on the same Kafka
partition (partition_key_field="run_id" in the event registry).

    onex.evt.omniclaude.skill-started.v1
