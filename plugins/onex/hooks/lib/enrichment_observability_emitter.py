"""Enrichment observability event emitter (OMN-2274, OMN-2441).

Builds and emits ``onex.evt.omniclaude.context-enrichment.v1`` events per
enrichment channel after the enrichment pipeline completes.

Canonical fields emitted (omnidash ContextEnrichmentEvent schema, OMN-2441):
    session_id          -- Claude Code session identifier
    timestamp           -- ISO-8601 UTC timestamp injected by the caller (parameter: ``emitted_at``)
    correlation_id      -- trace correlation ID propagated from the hook
    channel             -- enrichment channel: "summarization", "code_analysis", "similarity"
    model_name          -- model identifier (from handler, or "" if unknown)
    cache_hit           -- always False (cache tracking not yet implemented)
    outcome             -- "hit", "miss", "error", or "inflated"
    latency_ms          -- wall-clock duration of the enrichment in milliseconds
    tokens_before       -- token count of the original prompt (pre-enrichment)
    tokens_after        -- token count of the produced markdown (0 on failure)
    net_tokens_saved    -- tokens_before - tokens_after (summarization channel only)
    similarity_score    -- optional float [0.0, 1.0] from handler (similarity channel)
    quality_score       -- always None (quality tracking not yet implemented)
    repo                -- repository name derived from project_path
    agent_name          -- agent that triggered the enrichment

Internal handler metadata fields (not in omnidash schema):
    fallback_used       -- True when handler fell back to a simpler strategy
    was_dropped         -- True when the enrichment was produced but dropped by the token cap
    prompt_version      -- optional prompt template version string

Usage::

    from enrichment_observability_emitter import emit_enrichment_events

    emit_enrichment_events(
        session_id="...",
        correlation_id="...",
        results=raw_results,       # all completed _EnrichmentResult objects
        kept_names={"summarization", "code_analysis"},
        original_prompt_token_count=500,
        project_path="/path/to/repo",
        agent_name="polymorphic-agent",
    )

Design notes:
- Non-blocking: any emission failure is silently swallowed so the hook path
  is unaffected.
- Emission uses emit_client_wrapper.emit_event() via the socket daemon.
- ``was_dropped`` is True when the enrichment produced content but was
  excluded by _apply_token_cap (i.e. it is in raw_results but not in kept).
- ``outcome`` is derived from result state:
    - "hit"      when success=True and tokens > 0
    - "miss"     when success=True and tokens == 0
    - "error"    when success=False
    - "inflated" when success=True and tokens_after > tokens_before (summarization only)
- ``net_tokens_saved`` applies only to the summarization channel: it is the
  difference between tokens_before (original prompt count) and tokens_after
  (summarized result count).  For all other channels it is 0.
- Legacy backward-compat alias fields (enrichment_type, model_used,
  result_token_count, tokens_saved, relevance_score) were removed in OMN-2463
  after omnidash consumers completed migration to the canonical names
  (channel, model_name, tokens_after, net_tokens_saved, similarity_score).

    Most arguments are required; ``emitted_at`` is required and must appear
    before the optional parameters (repository invariant: no ``datetime.now()``
    defaults inside builders).  ``tokens_before``, ``repo``, and ``agent_name``
    have defaults and may be omitted by callers.

    The payload uses the omnidash-canonical field names required by
    ``ContextEnrichmentEvent`` in omnidash's shared types (OMN-2441).
    Backward-compat alias fields were removed in OMN-2463 after omnidash
    consumers completed migration to canonical names.

    Per the repository invariant, callers must pass ``emitted_at`` explicitly
    so that the timestamp is deterministic in tests.  ``emit_enrichment_events``
    captures ``datetime.now(UTC)`` once per batch and passes the same instant
    to every per-channel call.  Test callers pass a fixed ``datetime`` directly.

        session_id: The Claude Code session identifier.

            Mapped to ``model_name`` in the canonical payload.
        latency_ms: Wall-clock duration of the enrichment attempt in milliseconds.
        result_token_count: Approximate token count of the produced markdown.
            Zero when the enrichment failed or produced no content.
            Mapped to ``tokens_after`` in the canonical payload.
        relevance_score: Optional float in [0.0, 1.0] from the handler.
            None when the handler does not report a relevance score.
            Mapped to ``similarity_score`` in the canonical payload.
        fallback_used: True when the handler used a simpler fallback strategy.
        net_tokens_saved: Tokens saved by the summarization channel
            (tokens_before - tokens_after, clamped to >= 0).  Zero for all
            other channels and when summarization produced no output.
            Emitted as ``net_tokens_saved`` in the canonical payload.
        was_dropped: True when the enrichment ran successfully but was excluded
            by the token-cap drop policy (overflow).
        prompt_version: Prompt template version string from the handler, or "".
        success: Whether the enrichment handler reported success.  Used to

            the timestamp once and pass it explicitly for deterministic testing.
