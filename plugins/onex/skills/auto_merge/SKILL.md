# Auto Merge

## Overview

Merge a GitHub PR after posting a Slack HIGH_RISK gate. A human must reply "merge" to proceed.
Silence does NOT consent — this gate requires explicit approval. Exit when PR is merged, held,
or timed out.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the auto-merge skill to merge PR #{pr_number}."

**Implements**: OMN-2525

## Quick Start

```
/auto-merge 123 org/repo
/auto-merge 123 org/repo --strategy merge
/auto-merge 123 org/repo --gate-timeout-hours 48
/auto-merge 123 org/repo --no-delete-branch
```

## CDQA Pre-Condition (Mandatory)

**CDQA gates must pass before any merge proceeds. This requirement applies on all invocation
paths — whether called from ticket-pipeline or directly.**

When invoked from `ticket-pipeline`: CDQA gates run in Phase 5.5 before this skill is
dispatched. The gate log is written to `~/.claude/skill-results/{context_id}/cdqa-gate-log.json`.

When invoked directly (not from ticket-pipeline): this skill MUST run the CDQA gates itself
before executing the merge mutation.

### Direct Invocation: CDQA gate check

```
1. Read: ~/.claude/skill-results/{context_id}/cdqa-gate-log.json
   If record exists with overall=PASS or overall=bypassed AND pr_number matches:
     → skip re-run, proceed to Step 1
   If no matching record:
     → run all 3 CDQA gates (see @_lib/cdqa-gate/helpers.md)
     → BLOCK result: post HIGH_RISK bypass gate, await operator reply
     → BLOCK + held/timeout: exit with status: held
     → all PASS or bypassed: proceed to Step 1
```

**There is no `--skip-cdqa` flag.** Bypassing CDQA requires the explicit Slack bypass
protocol documented in `@_lib/cdqa-gate/helpers.md`. Any attempt to invoke auto-merge
without CDQA gates passing (or a recorded bypass) must exit with `status: error` and
message: `"CDQA gates not passed — run contract-compliance-check and verify CI gates"`.

---

## Merge Flow (Tier-Aware)

**Timeout model**: `gate_timeout_hours` is a single shared wall-clock budget for the entire flow (Steps 2 + 4 combined). A wall-clock start time is recorded on entry; each poll checks elapsed time against this budget. If the budget is exhausted in either phase, the skill exits with `status: timeout`.

### Step 1: Fetch PR State (Tier-Aware) <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

The merge readiness check depends on the current ONEX tier (see `@_lib/tier-routing/helpers.md`):

**FULL_ONEX Path**:
```python
from omniclaude.nodes.node_git_effect.models import GitOperation, ModelGitRequest

request = ModelGitRequest(
    operation=GitOperation.PR_VIEW,
    repo=repo,
    pr_number=pr_number,
    json_fields=["mergeable", "mergeStateStatus", "reviewDecision",
                 "statusCheckRollup", "latestReviews"],
)
result = await handler.pr_view(request)
```

**STANDALONE / EVENT_BUS Path**:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_bin/pr-merge-readiness.sh --pr {pr_number} --repo {repo}
# Returns: { ready, mergeable, ci_status, review_decision, merge_state_status, blockers }
```

### Step 2: Poll CI Readiness <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

Poll CI readiness (check every 60s until `mergeStateStatus == "CLEAN"`; consumes from the shared `gate_timeout_hours` budget):
   - Each cycle: fetch `mergeable` and `mergeStateStatus`, log both fields:
     ```text
     [auto-merge] poll cycle {N}: mergeable={mergeable} mergeStateStatus={mergeStateStatus}
     ```
   - `mergeStateStatus == "CLEAN"`: exit poll loop, proceed to gate
   - `mergeStateStatus == "DIRTY"`: exit immediately with `status: error`, message: "PR has merge conflicts -- resolve before retrying"
   - `mergeStateStatus == "BEHIND"`, `"BLOCKED"`, `"UNSTABLE"`, `"HAS_HOOKS"`, or `"UNKNOWN"`: continue polling
   - Poll deadline exceeded (`gate_timeout_hours` elapsed): exit with `status: timeout`, message: "CI readiness poll timed out -- mergeStateStatus never reached CLEAN"

### Step 3: Post HIGH_RISK Slack Gate <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

Post HIGH_RISK Slack gate (see message format below).

### Step 4: Poll for Slack Reply <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

Poll for Slack reply (check every 5 minutes; this phase shares the same `gate_timeout_hours` budget started in Step 2):
   - On "merge" reply: execute merge (see Step 5)
   - On reject/hold reply (e.g., "hold", "cancel", "no"): exit with `status: held`
   - On budget exhausted: exit with `status: timeout`

### Step 5: Execute Merge (Explicit `gh` Exception) <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

**The merge mutation always uses `gh pr merge` directly** -- this is an explicit exception
to the tier routing policy. Rationale: the merge is a thin CLI call (single mutation, no
parsing of output needed). There is no benefit to routing through `node_git_effect.pr_merge()`
for this operation.

```bash
gh pr merge {pr_number} --repo {repo} --{strategy} {--delete-branch if delete_branch}
```

This exception is documented and intentional. All other PR operations (view, list, checks)
use tier-aware routing.

### Step 6: Post Merge Notification and Close Linear Ticket <!-- ai-slop-ok: genuine process step heading in skill documentation, not LLM boilerplate -->

After a successful merge:

1. **Post Slack notification** on merge completion.
2. **Close Linear ticket** (if `ticket_id` is available in context — passed by `ticket-pipeline`):
   ```python
   if ticket_id:
       try:
           mcp__linear-server__save_issue(id=ticket_id, state="Done")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"[auto-merge] Warning: Could not mark {ticket_id} as Done: {e}")
           # Non-blocking: merge already succeeded; do not fail the skill
   ```
   This is a belt-and-suspenders step. The primary path (`ticket-pipeline` Phase 6)
   also marks the ticket Done. The `linear-close-on-merge` GitHub Actions workflow
   (`.github/workflows/linear-close-on-merge.yml`) runs unconditionally on every PR
   merge to main/develop, ensuring ticket closure even when the pipeline session has
   ended (simultaneous closes from multiple paths are safe — Linear state updates are idempotent).

**Ticket ID resolution order:**
1. Passed explicitly as `--ticket-id OMN-XXXX` argument
2. Extracted from PR branch name via `OMN-XXXX` pattern (fallback if `--ticket-id` not provided)
   (branch name extraction: `git branch --show-current | grep -ioE '(OMN|omn)-[0-9]+' | head -1 | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'`; only reliable when session is checked out on the PR branch — returns empty string if HEAD is detached)
3. Skip update if neither resolves to a valid ID

## Slack Gate Message Format

```
[HIGH_RISK] auto-merge: Ready to merge PR #{pr_number}

Repo: {repo}
PR: {pr_title}
Strategy: {strategy}
Branch: {branch_name}

All gates passed:
  CI: passed
  PR Review: approved (or changes resolved)

Reply "merge" to proceed. Silence = HOLD (this gate requires explicit approval).
Gate expires in {gate_timeout_hours}h.
```

## Skill Result Output

**Output contract:** `ModelSkillResult` from `omnibase_core.models.skill`

> **Note: This contract reference is behavioral guidance for the LLM executing this skill. Runtime validation not yet implemented.**

Write to: `~/.claude/skill-results/{context_id}/auto_merge.json`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `skill_name` | `"auto-merge"` |
| `status` | One of the canonical string values: `"success"`, `"gated"`, `"error"` (see mapping below) |
| `extra_status` | Domain-specific status string (see mapping below) |
| `run_id` | Correlation ID |
| `repo` | Repository slug (org/repo) |
| `pr_number` | PR number |
| `ticket_id` | Linear ticket ID (e.g. `"OMN-3262"`) or `null` |
| `extra` | `{"merge_commit": str, "strategy": str, "ticket_close_status": str}` |

> **Note on `context_id`:** Prior schema versions included `context_id` as a top-level field. This field is not part of `ModelSkillResult` — it belongs to the file path convention (`~/.claude/skill-results/{context_id}/auto_merge.json`). Consumers should derive context from the file path, not from `context_id` in the result body.

**Status mapping:**

| Current status | Canonical `status` (string value) | `extra_status` |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| `merged` | `"success"` (`EnumSkillResultStatus.SUCCESS`) | `"merged"` |
| `held` | `"gated"` (`EnumSkillResultStatus.GATED`) | `"held"` |
| `timeout` | `"error"` (`EnumSkillResultStatus.ERROR`) | `"timeout"` |
| `error` | `"error"` (`EnumSkillResultStatus.ERROR`) | `null` |

**Behaviorally significant `extra_status` values:**
- `"merged"` → ticket-pipeline treats as SUCCESS; clears ledger, updates Linear to Done
- `"held"` → ticket-pipeline treats as GATED; pipeline exits with `held` state (non-terminal), awaits human "merge" reply to resume
- `"timeout"` → ticket-pipeline treats as ERROR; merge gate expired — retryable with a new pipeline run

**Promotion rule for `extra` fields:** If a field appears in 3+ producer skills, open a ticket to evaluate promotion to a first-class field. If any orchestrator consumer (epic-team, ticket-pipeline) branches on `extra["x"]`, that field MUST be promoted.

Example result:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "auto_merge",
  "status": "success",
  "extra_status": "merged",
  "pr_number": 123,
  "repo": "org/repo",
  "ticket_id": "OMN-3262",
  "run_id": "pipeline-1709856000-OMN-3262",
  "extra": {
    "merge_commit": "abc1234",
    "strategy": "squash",
    "ticket_close_status": "closed"
  }
}
```

**`ticket_id`**: The Linear ticket identifier closed in Step 6 (e.g. `"OMN-3262"`), or `null` if no ticket was identified.

**`extra["ticket_close_status"]`** values:
- `"closed"`: `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` succeeded; ticket marked Done
- `"skipped"`: No `ticket_id` could be resolved — explicit arg absent and branch-name extraction returned empty
- `"failed"`: `save_issue` call raised an exception; merge still succeeded (non-blocking)
- `null`: Step 6 was not reached (skill exited before merge — `status` is `gated`, `error`)

| `/auto-merge 123 org/repo --strategy merge` | Interactive: use merge commit strategy |
| `Skill(skill="onex:auto-merge", args="123 org/repo --gate-timeout-hours 48")` | Programmatic: composable invocation from orchestrator |
| `auto-merge.sh 123 org/repo --no-delete-branch` | Shell: direct invocation, keep branch after merge |

## Tier Routing (OMN-2828)

PR merge readiness checks use tier-aware backend selection:

| Tier | Readiness Check | Merge Execution |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| `FULL_ONEX` | `node_git_effect.pr_view()` | `gh pr merge` (explicit exception) |
| `STANDALONE` | `_bin/pr-merge-readiness.sh` | `gh pr merge` (explicit exception) |
| `EVENT_BUS` | `_bin/pr-merge-readiness.sh` | `gh pr merge` (explicit exception) |

**Merge execution exception**: The actual `gh pr merge` call is always direct -- it is a
thin mutation (single API call, no output parsing). Routing it through `node_git_effect`
adds complexity without benefit. This is the only exception to the tier routing policy.

Tier detection: see `@_lib/tier-routing/helpers.md`.
