# Failure Taxonomy

Reference document for the 11 failure classes detected by the gap skill's probe system.

## Categories

- **CONTRACT_DRIFT**: A declared contract (topic name, model field, FK target, API spec, topic registry) no longer matches reality across repos.
- **ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION**: A structural boundary rule (DB access, env activation, projection lag, migration parity, legacy config) is violated.

## Auto-Fix Policy

| Policy | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| NO (GATE) | Requires human decision before any change is made. The skill emits a decision gate and waits for `--choose`. |
| LOCAL-ONLY auto-fix | The skill can fix the local repo's registry file automatically, but cannot mutate the broker or remote registries. |
| YES (search-replace) | The skill can apply a deterministic search-and-replace fix without human review. |

## Failure Classes

| # | boundary_kind | category | Auto-fix? | Description |
|---|---------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | kafka_topic | CONTRACT_DRIFT | NO (GATE) | Producer and consumer disagree on a Kafka topic string (byte-for-byte mismatch). |
| 2 | model_field | CONTRACT_DRIFT | NO (GATE) | A Pydantic model field type differs between the producing and consuming repo. |
| 3 | fk_reference | CONTRACT_DRIFT | NO (GATE) | A foreign-key target table referenced in one repo does not exist in the dependent repo's schema. |
| 4 | api_contract | CONTRACT_DRIFT | NO (GATE) | The OpenAPI spec hash in the provider repo does not match what the consumer repo expects. |
| 5 | db_boundary | ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION | NO (GATE) | A repo that must not access upstream databases contains DB driver imports or DB URL env vars. |
| 6 | topic_registry | CONTRACT_DRIFT | LOCAL-ONLY auto-fix | A topic declared in a contract YAML is missing from the local `TopicRegistry` enum but exists on the broker. The skill can add the enum member locally. |
| 7 | env_activation | ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION | NO (GATE) | A node's contract YAML declares a required env var that is not present in the activation environment (`~/.omnibase/.env` or Infisical). |
| 8 | projection_lag | ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION | NO (GATE) | A Kafka consumer group's lag on a topic partition exceeds the configured threshold, indicating stale read-model projections. |
| 9 | auth_config | CONTRACT_DRIFT | NO (GATE) | An Infisical or service-identity client configuration has drifted from the expected values declared in the contract. |
| 10 | migration_parity | ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION | NO (GATE) | A repo's migration state (Alembic head, schema checksum) does not match the expected state after a cross-repo release. |
| 11 | legacy_config | ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION | YES (search-replace) | A file contains a pattern from the legacy denylist (deprecated env vars, decommissioned endpoints, removed paths). |

## Probe-to-Class Mapping

Probes 2.1 through 2.5 (existing) map to failure classes 1-5.
Probes 2.6 through 2.11 (new) map to failure classes 6-11.

| Probe | Failure Class | boundary_kind |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 2.1 | 1 | kafka_topic |
| 2.2 | 2 | model_field |
| 2.3 | 3 | fk_reference |
| 2.4 | 4 | api_contract |
| 2.5 | 5 | db_boundary |
| 2.6 | 6 | topic_registry |
| 2.7 | 7 | env_activation |
| 2.8 | 8 | projection_lag |
| 2.9 | 9 | auth_config |
| 2.10 | 10 | migration_parity |
| 2.11 | 11 | legacy_config |
