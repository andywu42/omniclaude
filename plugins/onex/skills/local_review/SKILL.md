# Local Review

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the local-review skill."

## Usage

```
/local-review
/local-review --uncommitted
/local-review --since HEAD~3
/local-review --max-iterations 5 --required-clean-runs 2
/local-review --no-fix
/local-review --dry-run
```

## Execution

### Step 1 — Parse arguments

- `--uncommitted` → review only unstaged/staged changes
- `--since` → base ref for diff (default: auto-detected from branch)
- `--max-iterations` → cap on review-fix cycles (default: 10)
- `--required-clean-runs` → consecutive clean passes needed (default: 2)
- `--no-fix` → report issues only, no code changes
- `--no-commit` → fix but don't commit (leave staged)
- `--dry-run` → log decisions only; do not write edits or commits

### Step 2 — Initialize FSM

```bash
cd /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/omnimarket  # local-path-ok
uv run python -m omnimarket.nodes.node_local_review \
  [--uncommitted] \
  [--since <ref>] \
  [--max-iterations <n>] \
  [--required-clean-runs <n>] \
  [--no-fix] \
  [--no-commit] \
  [--dry-run]
```

Outputs `ModelLocalReviewState` JSON with initial phase.

### Step 3 — Execute review loop

Repeat until N consecutive clean passes or max iterations reached:

1. **REVIEW**: Inspect changed files (ruff, mypy, tests, CLAUDE.md conventions, aislop patterns)
2. **FIX**: Apply fixes for each finding (unless `--no-fix`)
3. **COMMIT**: Stage and commit fixes with `fix(review): <description>` (unless `--no-commit`)
4. **CHECK_CLEAN**: Re-run review on committed changes; count consecutive clean passes

→ DONE when `consecutive_clean >= required_clean_runs`
→ FAILED if circuit breaker (3 consecutive phase failures) trips

### Step 4 — Report

Write `ModelSkillResult` to `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/skill-results/{context_id}/local-review.json`.
Display: iterations run, issues found/fixed, final clean status, any remaining nits.

## Architecture

```
SKILL.md   -> thin shell (this file)
node       -> omnimarket/src/omnimarket/nodes/node_local_review/ (FSM logic)
contract   -> node_local_review/contract.yaml
```
