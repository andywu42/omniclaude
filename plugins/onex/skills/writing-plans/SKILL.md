# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use executing-plans to implement this plan phase-by-phase.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

```markdown
## Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Adversarial Review Pass

After the draft plan is generated and staged (file write completed or draft text assembled), run this structured review BEFORE presenting the final output. Fix all issues inline, re-save if writing to file, then present the corrected plan.

**Announce:** "Draft staged. Running adversarial review..."

Review posture: default to finding problems. Journal-critique format. No praise. No qualifiers. Name each failure by category.

---

### R1 — Count Integrity

Scan all numeric quantifiers near "items", "tasks", "tickets", "phases" and recompute each count from the actual list structure — count headings, bullet items, and ticket identifiers, then compare against every numeric claim.

- Phase splits (4a/4b) are separate tasks — count them separately
- Fix prose references to match reality, not the other way around
- Exclude ranges ("2-3 days", "1 to 3 steps") — these are estimates, not count claims

### R2 — Acceptance Criteria Strength

For each task's acceptance criteria:

- **Superset trap**: "superset of N" → "exactly N: [list them]" (unless open-ended addition is intentional)
- **Weak verification**: "tests pass" → "exactly these N tests pass, each asserting [specific behavior]"
- **Missing guards**: add "no X beyond Y" where drift is likely ("no new DB extensions", "no new imports outside this module")
- **Vague output**: "valid output" → "output contains fields [a, b, c] with types [X, Y, Z]"
- **Subjective language ban**: every acceptance criterion must be testable without subjective qualifiers. Ban "should", "nice", "clean", "robust" unless paired with a measurable check. "Clean separation" → "no imports from module X in module Y".
- **Unresolved placeholders**: scan for angle-bracket placeholders (`<files>`, `<module>`, `<path>`, etc.) in procedural steps and acceptance criteria. Every `<placeholder>` must be resolved to a concrete value before the plan ships. Flag any that remain unresolved.

### R3 — Scope Violations

For each task, ask: can its stated scope implement everything it claims?

- A DB-only migration task cannot enforce Python runtime guards
- A "test-only" task cannot add production code behavior
- A "schema-only" task cannot validate runtime behavior
- **Doc-only edits cannot enforce runtime behavior unless the doc is a confirmed runtime instruction source (prove it)**

Move mismatched criteria to the task with the correct scope.

### R4 — Integration Traps

Mandatory mechanical checks — required, not suggested:

- **Import paths**: any new class or function referenced — is its module path confirmed from an existing import in the repo? If asserted without a reference, add: "Mirror import from `path/to/existing.py`." Do not invent paths.
- **Contract module paths**: if contract.yaml references `module: "foo.bar.models"`, confirm `foo/bar/models/__init__.py` re-exports the name, or change module to the full file-level path. If unverified, add the re-export step explicitly.
- **API signatures**: any callable invoked across a boundary — pin exact keyword argument names to a real existing call site. "publish(payload)" is wrong if the real signature is "publish(data=..., event_type=...)". Must-verify, not assumed.
- **Return types**: write the actual import path or "returns dict shaped like ModelFoo JSON" — not "returns ModelFoo type" without a path.
- **Topics and schema names**: if a topic string is introduced, prove it matches the naming spec and is registered via the designated mechanism. If an event model is referenced, prove the module path exists or the `__init__.py` re-export exists.
- **CLI command consistency**: for any CLI command used across multiple tasks (e.g., `pytest`, `gh pr`, `ruff`), verify all occurrences use the same explicit argument set. Flag any instance where argument substitution differs between tasks unless the difference is intentionally documented. Example: Task 2 runs `pytest tests/ -v` but Task 5 runs `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` — flag the discrepancy or justify it.
- **Path portability**: flag absolute paths containing machine-specific mounts (`/Volumes/`, `/Users/`, `/home/<user>/`, `C:\Users\`). Require `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`, `$REPO_ROOT`, or relative paths instead. Exception: paths inside user-facing documentation that explicitly instruct the reader to substitute their own path. <!-- local-path-ok -->

### R5 — Idempotency

For any task that creates or modifies resources, the plan must state how reruns behave and what the dedup key is:

- Tickets: dedup key is exact title match under parent epic
- DB tables: use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; dedup key is primary key or unique index
- Seed scripts: must specify dedup key or upsert logic — not just "run script"
- Files: check for existence before writing
- Doc edits: replace, not append — add a grep check that each inserted heading appears only once after the edit

If a task creates resources and the plan does not state the dedup mechanism, flag it.

### R6 — Verification Soundness

For each verification step, assign a proof grade:

- **strong**: schema introspection + rollback + runtime call
- **medium**: unit test asserts specific fields or types
- **weak**: log contains string, command exits 0, file exists

Rule: any weak proof used as the sole evidence for a core invariant must be paired with at least one medium or strong proof.

Common failures to flag:

- "pytest runs" != schema correct → add `\d+ table_name` introspection + rollback verification
- "JSON valid" != correct payload → assert specific field names and types (medium)
- "import resolves" != handler loads → call the factory and assert handler type (strong)
- "grep finds no hits" != feature removed → also check runtime execution path
- "log contains X" != behavior correct → also assert state or output (not log alone)

**Placement verification**: when string order matters (e.g., "insert section X before section Y", "add import above existing imports"), require grep-with-context (`grep -n -A2 -B2`) or line-number ordering proof showing the before/after positions. A bare "grep finds the string" does not prove correct placement — it only proves existence. Acceptable proof: line N1 < line N2 after the edit, confirmed via `grep -n`.

### R7 — Behavioral Expansion Check

For any change described as "close a gap," "fix a missing case," or "align behavior":

- Determine whether the change **adds behavior the skill/module previously lacked** (functional expansion) versus **correcting existing behavior** (bug fix).
- If functional expansion: require an explicit "functional expansion" label on the task. This signals that doc references, changelog entries, and downstream consumers must be reconciled.
- Reconciliation checklist:
  - Does any existing documentation describe the old (narrower) behavior as intentional? If yes, update the doc or justify the expansion.
  - Does any caller rely on the old behavior (e.g., expecting an error or empty result where the expansion now returns data)? If yes, flag as a potential breaking change.
  - Does the expansion introduce new failure modes not covered by existing error handling? If yes, add error handling steps to the plan.
- If a task claims to "close a gap" but the plan contains no new code paths, test cases, or error handling — flag it as under-specified.

### R8 — Prerequisite Guards

For any new phase, step, or task added to a skill or pipeline:

- Explicitly list all required execution conditions: authentication state, clean git working tree, named branch (not detached HEAD), env vars loaded, services running, prior phase completion.
- For each condition, specify what happens if the condition is unmet:
  - **Fail loudly**: the step errors with a clear message (preferred).
  - **Fail silently**: the step proceeds but produces wrong/incomplete results (must be flagged and fixed).
  - **Skip gracefully**: the step is skipped with a logged reason.
- Flag any new phase where failure is silent if conditions are unmet. Silent failures must be converted to loud failures or graceful skips with explicit guard checks.
- Common prerequisite omissions to catch:
  - Git operations without checking for uncommitted changes
  - API calls without verifying auth tokens are set
  - File reads without checking file existence
  - Docker/service calls without verifying the service is running
  - Phase N+1 that assumes Phase N succeeded without checking its output

### Review Output Format

Each category must be explicitly acknowledged with a minimal evidence pointer, even when clean:

```
**Adversarial review complete.**

R1: checked — clean (counted N tasks under section X; all numeric claims match)
R2: checked — [issue: "superset of 7" → fixed to "exactly 7: [list]"] OR [clean (all criteria testable, no subjective language, no unresolved <placeholders>)]
R3: checked — [issue: kill-switch criterion moved to Task 3 (DB task cannot enforce Python behavior)] OR [clean]
R4: checked — [issue: added __init__.py re-export for contract module path] OR [clean (verified: contract module path resolves at omnibase_infra/nodes/foo/models/__init__.py; CLI args consistent; no machine-specific paths)]
R5: checked — [issue: Ticket 2 creates DB table without IF NOT EXISTS] OR [clean (dedup keys: ticket=title, table=PK)]
R6: checked — [issue: "pytest passes" was sole proof for schema — added \d+ introspection] OR [clean (strongest proof: strong; placement verified with line numbers where applicable)]
R7: checked — [issue: Task 3 "closes gap" but adds new code path without "functional expansion" label] OR [clean (no gap-closing claims, or all labeled and reconciled)]
R8: checked — [issue: Phase 2 runs a push to remote without checking for clean working tree] OR [clean (all phases list prerequisites; no silent failures)]

Summary: [N] issues found and fixed. Plan re-saved.
```

Do not claim "clean" for a category that was not explicitly checked with evidence.

### Smoke Test (Verification)

Run these instructions against the following known-bad mini-plan and confirm all expected catches:

> "This plan creates **4 tickets** (Tickets 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b).
> Ticket 2 (DB-only migration): acceptance criteria: kill switch enforced via FEATURE_FLAG env var check in Python handler. Verification: pytest passes.
> Contract module: omnibase_infra.nodes.foo.models.
> Ticket 3: No mention of models/__init__.py.
> Ticket 3 step 2: Run `pytest tests/ -v`. Ticket 3 step 5: Run `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`.
> Ticket 3 step 3: Edit `/Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/omnibase_core/src/foo.py`. <!-- local-path-ok -->
> Ticket 3 acceptance: copy `<files>` to the output directory.
> Ticket 4a: 'Close the gap where bar handler ignores empty input' — no new tests, no error handling added.
> Ticket 4b: New phase 'publish results' — runs `gh pr create` but does not check for auth or clean git state.
> Ticket 4b step 4: Insert the new section before the existing 'Summary' heading. Verification: grep finds 'New Section'."

Expected catches by category: R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, R8.

- **R1**: "4 tickets" but five identifiers listed (1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b) — count mismatch, flag
- **R2**: "pytest passes" is weak and vague — does not assert specific behavior. Also: `<files>` is an unresolved angle-bracket placeholder — flag it
- **R3**: DB-only Ticket 2 claims Python runtime behavior (kill switch) — scope violation, move to code task
- **R4**: Contract module path unverified, no re-export step mentioned — add re-export or full path. Also: `pytest` args differ between step 2 and step 5 (`-v` vs `-v --tb=short`) — flag inconsistency. Also: `/Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/...` is a machine-specific absolute path — replace with `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/src/foo.py` or equivalent <!-- local-path-ok -->
- **R6**: "pytest passes" is weak (grade: weak) as sole proof for a DB migration — needs schema introspection. Also: "grep finds 'New Section'" proves existence but not placement — need `grep -n` to confirm line ordering (new section line < summary heading line)
- **R7**: Ticket 4a "closes gap" but adds no new tests or error handling — under-specified functional expansion, flag
- **R8**: Ticket 4b phase runs `gh pr create` without checking for auth token or clean git state — silent failure if conditions unmet, flag

R5 is clean in this mini-plan (no idempotency claims without dedup keys). That is an acceptable clean result.

If the review instructions do not catch all expected items, tighten the instructions before shipping.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, hand off to the executing-plans skill:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`.**

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use executing-plans to implement this plan phase-by-phase."

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use executing-plans (v2 flow)
- executing-plans drives phase-by-phase execution via the epic-team / ticket-pipeline routing
