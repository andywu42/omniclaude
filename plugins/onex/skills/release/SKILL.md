# Release

## Overview

Composable skill that orchestrates a coordinated multi-repo release across the entire OmniNode
package ecosystem. Repos are released in strict dependency-tier order to ensure that downstream
packages can pin exact versions of their upstream dependencies.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the release skill."

**SAFETY INVARIANT**: Release is a HIGH_RISK action. Silence is NEVER consent for
the gate. Explicit approval required unless `--gate-attestation=<token>` is passed with a
valid pre-issued token.

## Quick Start

```
/release                                          # Release all repos (infer bumps)
/release --dry-run                                # Show plan, don't execute
/release omnibase_core omnibase_infra             # Release specific repos only
/release --bump minor                             # Force minor bump for all
/release --resume release-20260225-a3f7b2         # Resume a failed run
/release --skip-pypi-wait                         # Don't wait for PyPI propagation
/release --gate-attestation=1740312612.000100:release-20260225-a3f7b2  # Bypass gate
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `repos` | `list[str]` | all | Repo names to release (positional, space-separated) |
| `--all` | flag | — | Explicitly release all repos in dependency graph |
| `--bump` | `major\|minor\|patch` | inferred | Override bump level for all repos |
| `--dry-run` | flag | false | Show plan table and exit; zero side effects |
| `--resume` | `<run_id>` | — | Resume a previously failed run from its state file |
| `--skip-pypi-wait` | flag | false | Don't block on PyPI availability after publish |
| `--pypi-timeout-minutes` | int | 10 | Max minutes to wait for PyPI propagation per repo |
| `--run-id` | string | auto | Override the auto-generated run ID |
| `--gate-attestation` | `<slack_ts>:<run_id>` | — | Pre-issued gate token to bypass Slack HIGH_RISK gate |

## Dependency Graph (Tier Order)

Repos are released in strict tier order. Within a tier, repos are released sequentially
(not in parallel) to avoid race conditions on shared CI runners.

```
Tier 0: omnibase_compat       (zero OmniNode deps — releases independently)
Tier 1: omnibase_spi          (no internal deps)
Tier 2: omnibase_core         (depends on: omnibase_spi)
Tier 3: omnibase_infra        (depends on: omnibase_core, omnibase_spi)
         omniintelligence      (depends on: omnibase_core, omnibase_spi)
         omnimemory            (depends on: omnibase_core, omnibase_spi)
Tier 4: omniclaude            (depends on: omnibase_core, omnibase_infra, omniintelligence)
```

**Drift guard**: Before execution, the skill verifies that every repo in `omni_home` that
declares a `pyproject.toml` with OmniNode dependencies is present in the tier graph. If a
repo is found that is not in the graph, the skill fails immediately with `GRAPH_DRIFT`.

### Tier Execution Rule

A tier N repo is only released after ALL tier N-1 repos have completed (including tag push
and optional PyPI availability confirmation). This ensures that when a tier N repo pins
`omnibase_core==X.Y.Z`, that version is actually published and installable.

## Execution Algorithm

```
1. VALIDATE
   - If --gate-attestation is set and token format is invalid → error immediately
   - If --resume is set → load state file, validate run_id, skip to resume point

2. SCAN (sequential, per tier order):
   For each repo:
     a. Find last git tag matching <repo>/vX.Y.Z pattern
     b. Read pyproject.toml version (may differ from tag if manually bumped)
     c. Use max(tag_version, pyproject_version) as base version
        (prevents downgrades when pyproject was bumped without a tag)
     d. Count commits since last tag
     e. Infer bump level from conventional commit prefixes:
        - feat:     → minor
        - fix:      → patch
        - BREAKING CHANGE / feat!: / fix!: → major
        - No unreleased commits → skip (NOTHING_TO_RELEASE for this repo)
     f. Apply --bump override if set (overrides inference for all repos)
     g. Compute new version from base version + bump level

3. DRIFT GUARD:
   Compare scanned repo set against hardcoded tier graph.
   If mismatch → fail with GRAPH_DRIFT error, print expected vs actual

4. PLAN DISPLAY:
   Render table:
     repo | tier | current | new | bump | commits | status
   Compute plan_hash = SHA256(JSON(plan))

5. If --dry-run: print table, emit ModelSkillResult(status=DRY_RUN), exit

6. GATE:
   If --gate-attestation=<token>:
     Validate token format, use for audit trail
   Else:
     Post HIGH_RISK Slack gate with plan table + plan_hash
     Invoke slack_gate_poll.py to poll for reply
     Parse reply (approve / reject)
     If rejected or timeout: emit ModelSkillResult(status=FAILED), exit

7. EXECUTE (sequential tiers, sequential repos within tier):
   For each tier (1 → 4):
     For each repo in tier:
       Execute 12 sub-steps (see Per-Repo Release Sub-Steps below)
       Update state file after each sub-step (atomic write)
       On failure: mark repo as FAILED, halt remaining repos in this tier + all later tiers

8. CLEANUP:
   Remove worktrees
   Archive state file to ~/.claude/state/release/archive/

9. SUMMARY:
   Print summary table: repo | old → new | PR | tag | PyPI
   Post summary to Slack (LOW_RISK, informational)

10. EMIT ModelSkillResult
```

## Per-Repo Release Sub-Steps

Each repo goes through 12 sequential sub-steps. State is persisted after each sub-step
for resume support.

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | WORKTREE | Create worktree at `omni_worktrees/release/<run_id>/<repo>/` on branch `release/<run_id>/<repo>` |
| 2 | BUMP | Update `version` field in `pyproject.toml` to new version. For `omnibase_infra`: also slides `VERSION_MATRIX` bounds in `version_compatibility.py` and validates `Dockerfile.runtime` plugin pins (see Per-Repo Notes below) |
| 3 | PIN | Update dependency pins in `pyproject.toml` to `==X.Y.Z` for any same-run deps that have already completed |
| 4 | CHANGELOG | Generate CHANGELOG entry from conventional commits since last tag |
| 5 | LOCK | Run `uv lock` to regenerate lockfile with new version + pins |
| 6 | LINT | Run `pre-commit run --all-files`; fail repo on hook failure |
| 7 | COMMIT | `git commit -am "release: <repo> vX.Y.Z [OMN-XXXX]"` |
| 8 | PUSH | Push branch via `_lib/pr-safety/safe_push()` to `origin release/<run_id>/<repo>` |
| 9 | PR | Create PR via `gh pr create` (dedupe check first); reference `pr-safety` helpers |
| 10 | MERGE | Merge PR via `gh pr merge --squash` (reference `auto-merge` sub-skill) |
| 11 | TAG | Create and push tag `<repo>/vX.Y.Z` (dedupe check: skip if tag exists) |
| 12 | PUBLISH | Trigger `release.yml` / `auto-tag-reusable.yml` GitHub Action; optionally wait for PyPI availability |

### Pin Policy

**MVP**: Exact pins only (`==X.Y.Z`). When a tier N repo depends on a tier N-1 repo
that was released in the same run, the dependency specifier is updated to `==<new_version>`.

Example: If `omnibase_core` was bumped to `1.5.0` in this run, then `omnibase_infra`'s
`pyproject.toml` dependency on `omnibase_core` becomes `omnibase_core==1.5.0`.

### Per-Repo Notes: omnibase_infra BUMP Actions

The `omnibase_infra` repo requires two additional automated actions during Sub-Step 2 (BUMP),
after the `pyproject.toml` version is updated. These run inline as part of the BUMP sub-step
(not as a separate phase). See `prompt.md` Sub-Step 2b for the authoritative implementation.

#### 1. version_compatibility.py — VERSION_MATRIX slide

**File**: `src/omnibase_infra/runtime/version_compatibility.py`

The `VERSION_MATRIX` defines the runtime-compatible version window for upstream packages
(`omnibase_core`, `omnibase_spi`). After each coordinated release, the bounds must slide
to match the new upstream versions.

**Rule**: For each upstream package released in the same run:
- `min_version` → new upstream version (e.g. `0.22.0` → `0.23.0`)
- `max_version` → next minor after min (e.g. `0.23.0` → `0.24.0`)

**Idempotency**: If bounds already match the target values, the file is not modified.

Example — coordinated release bumping `omnibase_core` from `0.22.x` to `0.23.0`:

```python
# Before:
VersionConstraint(
    package="omnibase_core",
    min_version="0.22.0",
    max_version="0.23.0",
),

# After (auto-updated by release skill):
VersionConstraint(
    package="omnibase_core",
    min_version="0.23.0",
    max_version="0.24.0",
),
```

#### 2. Dockerfile.runtime — pin validation

**File**: `docker/Dockerfile.runtime`

Runtime plugin packages (`omniintelligence`, `omninode-claude`, `omninode-memory`) are
pinned with explicit version numbers and sometimes installed with `--no-deps` workarounds.

This step is **validation-only** — it does not auto-update Dockerfile pins. Plugin packages
are released on a separate cadence and may intentionally lag behind. The skill logs:
- The pinned version of each plugin package
- A warning for any package installed with `--no-deps` (workaround indicator)

**When a `--no-deps` warning appears**: A separate ticket should track updating that plugin
pin to a version with compatible transitive dependencies, at which point the `--no-deps`
flag can be removed.

### Smoke Test: Dry-Run Verification

To verify the `omnibase_infra` BUMP auto-updates are applied correctly without making
any real changes, run a dry-run release targeting only `omnibase_infra` and its upstreams:

```bash
# Dry-run: show plan + validate BUMP actions without committing
/release omnibase_spi omnibase_core omnibase_infra --dry-run
```

The dry-run output should show:
- `omnibase_infra` included in the plan with a valid bump level
- No errors from version_compatibility.py or Dockerfile.runtime validation

To verify the actual file mutations in isolation (without the full release pipeline),
create a temporary worktree and simulate the BUMP step manually:

```bash
# 1. Create a test worktree from main
git -C /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/omnibase_infra worktree add \  # local-path-ok
  /tmp/infra-bump-test -b test/bump-smoke-$(date +%s)

# 2. Simulate: bump version_compatibility.py for omnibase_core 0.23.0 → 0.24.0
python3 - <<'EOF'
import re, sys

vc_path = "/tmp/infra-bump-test/src/omnibase_infra/runtime/version_compatibility.py"
with open(vc_path) as f:
    content = f.read()

# Check current state
print("Current VERSION_MATRIX entry for omnibase_core:")
m = re.search(r'VersionConstraint\([^)]*package="omnibase_core"[^)]*\)', content, re.DOTALL)
if m:
    print(m.group(0))
else:
    print("  NOT FOUND")
EOF

# 3. Clean up test worktree
git -C /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/omnibase_infra worktree remove /tmp/infra-bump-test --force  # local-path-ok
```

**Acceptance criteria** (Definition of Done):
- `version_compatibility.py` bounds slide correctly for each upstream package in the run
- `Dockerfile.runtime` pins are logged; `--no-deps` workarounds emit warnings
- A full `--dry-run` of `omnibase_infra` completes without errors
- No manual edits to these files are needed in the next coordinated release

```

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SUCCESS` | All targeted repos released successfully |
| `PARTIAL` | Some repos released, some failed; released repos are tagged and published |
| `FAILED` | Unrecoverable error before any repo completed (gate rejected, graph drift, etc.) |
| `DRY_RUN` | Plan displayed, no changes made |

## State Model

### Run ID Generation

```
run_id = "release-<YYYYMMDD>-<short_hash>"

where short_hash = sha256(sorted_repo_names + date)[:6]
```

The run ID is deterministic given the same repo set and date, enabling idempotent resume.
Use `--run-id` to override for testing.

### State File

**Path**: `~/.claude/state/release/<run_id>.json`

```json

  "run_id": "release-20260225-a3f7b2",

      "pr_number": 42,
      "tag": "omnibase_spi/v1.2.1",
      "error": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase State Machine

Each repo transitions through phases in strict order. No phase may be skipped except via
resume (which re-enters at the last incomplete phase).

```
PLANNED → WORKTREE → BUMPED → PINNED → CHANGELOG → LOCKED → LINT → COMMITTED → PUSHED → PR_CREATED → MERGED → TAGGED → PUBLISHED → DONE
```

**Phase transition rules**:
- Forward-only: a repo never moves backwards in the state machine
- On failure: phase is set to the failing phase, `error` is populated
- On resume: execution restarts from the failing phase (not from PLANNED)
- DONE is terminal: a repo in DONE is never re-processed

### Resume Semantics

When invoked with `--resume <run_id>`:

1. Load state file from `~/.claude/state/release/<run_id>.json`
2. Validate run_id matches
3. For each repo in tier order:
   - If phase == `DONE`: skip entirely
   - If phase == any other value: restart from that phase
   - If phase == `PLANNED`: start fresh (first run or pre-scan failure)
4. Re-display the plan table (with completed repos marked)
5. Re-post Slack gate (unless `--gate-attestation` provided)
6. Execute remaining work

**Resume does NOT re-run completed phases.** If `omnibase_spi` is in `DONE` state, it
will not be re-scanned, re-bumped, or re-tagged. The state file is the source of truth.

### Atomic Writes

State file updates use the write-to-temp-then-rename pattern:

```python
import json, os, tempfile

def atomic_write_state(state: dict, path: str) -> None:
    """Write state file atomically to prevent corruption on crash."""
    dir_name = os.path.dirname(path)
    fd, tmp_path = tempfile.mkstemp(dir=dir_name, suffix=".tmp")
    try:
        with os.fdopen(fd, "w") as f:
            json.dump(state, f, indent=2)
        os.rename(tmp_path, path)
    except Exception:
        os.unlink(tmp_path)
        raise
```

This ensures that a crash mid-write never produces a corrupt state file. The previous
state file is always either the old version or the new version, never a partial write.

## Idempotency Keys

Every mutation has a corresponding idempotency check to make resume safe:

| Mutation | Idempotency Key | Check |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Create worktree | `release/<run_id>/<repo>` branch + path | If worktree path exists and branch matches, reuse |
| Version bump | `pyproject.toml` version field | If version already matches target, skip |
| Dependency pin | `pyproject.toml` dependency specifier | If pin already matches `==X.Y.Z`, skip |
| CHANGELOG entry | Entry header with version string | If entry for version exists, skip |
| uv lock | `uv.lock` content hash | Always re-run (cheap, ensures consistency) |
| Pre-commit | Pre-commit output | Always re-run (cheap, ensures clean state) |
| Git commit | Branch HEAD content | If HEAD message matches `release: <repo> vX.Y.Z`, skip |
| Git push | Remote branch state | If remote branch exists and matches local HEAD, skip |
| PR creation | Open PR with matching branch | `gh pr list --head <branch>` — if PR exists, reuse |
| PR merge | PR state | If PR is already merged, skip |
| Tag creation | Tag existence | `git tag -l <tag>` — if tag exists, skip push |
| PyPI publish | GitHub Action trigger | Trigger is idempotent (re-trigger is safe); PyPI rejects duplicate versions |

### Branch Naming Convention

```
release/<run_id>/<repo>

Example: release/release-20260225-a3f7b2/omnibase_core
```

This naming:
- Prevents collision with feature branches
- Encodes the run_id for audit trail
- Allows worktree reuse on resume (same branch name = same worktree)

### Run Marker

- State file existence at `~/.claude/state/release/<run_id>.json` = run in progress
- On successful completion: state file moved to `~/.claude/state/release/archive/<run_id>.json`
- On `--resume`: state file remains in active location until completion
- Stale runs: if a state file is older than 24 hours and status is not `completed`, it
  is considered stale. A new run for the same repos will warn but proceed (with a new run_id).

## Error Table

| Error | Code | Behavior | Recovery |

## Changelog

- **v1.2.0**: Fix version base computation — use `max(tag_version, pyproject_version)` to
  prevent downgrades when `pyproject.toml` was bumped without cutting a release tag.
  Also fix omniweb tech stack reference (Node.js/pnpm, not PHP).
- **v1.1.0** (OMN-3207): omnibase_infra BUMP automation — auto-slide VERSION_MATRIX bounds
  in `version_compatibility.py` and validate `Dockerfile.runtime` plugin pins as part of
  Sub-Step 2 (BUMP). Adds Per-Repo Notes section and smoke test documentation.
- **v1.0.0** (OMN-2805): Initial interface definition — arguments, dependency graph, error
  table, ModelSkillResult schema, state model, idempotency keys.
