description: Runtime registration and wiring verification — checks node descriptions are real (not compute+hash), all contract-declared handlers are wired in dispatch, all topics have both producer and consumer, and container logs are free of repeated errors. Auto-creates Linear tickets for unwired handlers and error-heavy containers.

# Runtime Sweep

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the runtime-sweep skill to verify runtime registration and wiring integrity."

## Usage

```
/runtime-sweep
/runtime-sweep --dry-run
/runtime-sweep --scope omnidash-only
```

## Execution

### Phase 1 — Parse arguments

- `--dry-run` → pass through to node
- `--scope` → `all-repos` (default) or `omnidash-only`

### Phase 2 — Run node

```bash
cd /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/omnimarket  # local-path-ok
uv run python -m omnimarket.nodes.node_runtime_sweep \
  --scope <all-repos|omnidash-only> \
  [--dry-run]
```

Capture stdout (JSON: `RuntimeSweepResult`). Exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = findings.

### Phase 3 — Render report

From the JSON output display four summary tables:

**Node Descriptions** — REAL / PLACEHOLDER / MISSING per contract

**Handler Wiring** — WIRED / UNWIRED / ORPHAN_TOPIC per handler file

**Topic Symmetry** — SYMMETRIC / PRODUCER_ONLY / CONSUMER_ONLY per topic

Report counts by finding type. List each finding with subject and type.

### Phase 3b — Docker Log Analysis

For each running container, call `get_container_logs()` via `docker_helper`:

```python
logs = docker_helper.get_container_logs(container_id, tail=500)
```

Classify container log health:
- **CLEAN**: no errors in last 500 lines
- **NOISY**: repeated non-fatal warnings
- **ERROR_HEAVY**: >10% of lines are errors
- **CRASH_LOOP**: container restarted in last 5 minutes

### Phase 4 — Ticket creation (skipped if `--dry-run`)

For each finding with type PLACEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION, MISSING_DESCRIPTION,
UNWIRED_HANDLER, ORPHAN_TOPIC, PRODUCER_ONLY, or CONSUMER_ONLY, create a
Linear ticket via `mcp__linear-server__save_issue`:

```
Title: fix(wiring): <finding_type> — <subject>
Project: Active Sprint
Labels: wiring, runtime-sweep
```

Skip ticket creation for REAL, WIRED, SYMMETRIC findings (healthy state).

### Phase 5 — Write skill result

Write to `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/skill-results/<run_id>/runtime-sweep.json`:

```json
{
  "skill": "runtime-sweep",
  "status": "clean | findings | error",
  "contracts_checked": 0,
  "total_findings": 0,
  "by_type": {}
}
```

## Architecture

```
SKILL.md  → thin shell: parse args → node dispatch → render results
node      → omnimarket/src/omnimarket/nodes/node_runtime_sweep/
contract  → node_runtime_sweep/contract.yaml
```

All wiring verification logic lives in the node handler. This skill does no analysis.
