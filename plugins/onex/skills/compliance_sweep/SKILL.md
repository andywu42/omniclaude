# Compliance Sweep

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the compliance-sweep skill."

## Usage

```
/compliance-sweep                              # Full scan, report only
/compliance-sweep --dry-run                    # Explicit dry-run
/compliance-sweep --repos omnibase_infra       # Scan one repo
/compliance-sweep --create-tickets             # Scan + create Linear tickets
/compliance-sweep --create-tickets --max-tickets 5
/compliance-sweep --json                       # JSON output
```

## Default Repos

omnibase_core, omnibase_infra, omniclaude, omniintelligence, omnimemory, omnimarket,
omninode_infra, onex_change_control

## Execution

### Phase 1 — Parse arguments

- `--repos` → comma-separated list (default: all handler repos)
- `--dry-run` → pass through to node
- `--create-tickets` → enable ticket creation after scan
- `--max-tickets` → cap on tickets created (default: 10)
- `--json` → output as JSON

### Phase 2 — Run scanner

Uses `arch-handler-contract-compliance` check from `onex_change_control`:

```bash
cd /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omni_home/onex_change_control  # local-path-ok
python scripts/validation/handler_contract_compliance.py \
  --root <repo>/src \
  [--repos <comma-list>]
```

Reports violations classified by verdict and type.

### Phase 3 — Render report

Verdicts per handler: COMPLIANT, IMPERATIVE, HYBRID, ALLOWLISTED, MISSING_CONTRACT

Violation types detected:
- HARDCODED_TOPIC
- UNDECLARED_TRANSPORT
- MISSING_HANDLER_ROUTING
- LOGIC_IN_NODE
- DIRECT_DB_ACCESS

Each violation: repo, handler path, node name, violation type, severity, message

Output: `ModelComplianceSweepReport`
Report path convention: `docs/registry/compliance-scan-<date>.json`

### Phase 4 — Ticket creation (only if `--create-tickets` and not `--dry-run`)

Group violations by node directory (one ticket per node). For each node with
violations not already tracked in Linear, create via `mcp__linear-server__save_issue`.
Ticket creation is idempotent — search for existing open tickets before creating.

```
Title: fix(compliance): migrate <node_name> to declarative pattern [OMN-6843]
Project: Active Sprint
Label: contract-compliance
```

Limit to `--max-tickets` tickets per run (default: 10).

### Phase 5 — Write skill result

Write to `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/skill-results/<run_id>/compliance-sweep.json`:

```json
{
  "skill": "compliance-sweep",
  "status": "compliant | violations_found | error",
  "handlers_scanned": 0,
  "total_violations": 0,
  "by_type": {},
  "by_severity": {}
}
```

## Architecture

```
SKILL.md  → thin shell: parse args → node dispatch → render results
node      → omnimarket/src/omnimarket/nodes/node_compliance_sweep/
contract  → node_compliance_sweep/contract.yaml
scanner   → onex_change_control/scripts/validation/handler_contract_compliance.py
```

All scanning logic lives in the node handler. This skill does no scanning.
