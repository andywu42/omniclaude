# PR Queue Pipeline (v1)

## Dispatch Requirement

When invoked, dispatch to a polymorphic-agent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="onex:polymorphic-agent",
  description="PR queue pipeline drain",
  prompt="Run the pr-queue-pipeline skill. <full context>"
)
```

**CRITICAL**: `subagent_type` MUST be `"onex:polymorphic-agent"` (with the `onex:` prefix).

## Overview

The daily "drain the queue" command. v1 adds `review-all-prs` as Phase 1, so the pipeline
applies code quality fixes before repairing CI/conflicts and merging. Use `--skip-review` to
restore v0 behavior (Phase 1 skipped).

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the pr-queue-pipeline skill."

**Recommended first run**: `/pr-queue-pipeline --authors me --dry-run` to preview scope.

**First v1 run**: Add `--skip-review` until `review-all-prs` has been validated standalone.

## v1 Phase Sequence

```
Phase 0: SCAN + CLASSIFY + BUILD PLAN
  - Consolidated scan of all repos in scope
  - Build: merge_ready[], needs_fix[]
  - Apply blast radius caps
  - Print plan. If --dry-run: stop here.

Phase 1: REVIEW (sequential — review-all-prs completes before Phase 2 begins)
  - Invoke: review-all-prs (runs local-review on all open PRs, pushes fix commits)
  - If --skip-review: Phase 1 skipped entirely
  - Re-scan after Phase 1 to re-classify PRs that got new commits

Phase 2: FIX (sequential — fix-prs completes before Phase 3 begins)
  - Invoke: fix-prs
  - If --skip-fix: Phase 2 skipped
  - Wait for completion before proceeding

Phase 3: GATE + MERGE (first pass)
  - Re-query merge_ready PRs (Phases 1+2 may have unblocked new ones)
  - Post single HIGH_RISK Slack gate
  - On approval: invoke merge-sweep --gate-attestation=<gate_token>

Phase 4: MERGE (second pass, conditional)
  - Condition: Phase 2 prs_fixed > 0 AND those PRs are now merge_ready
  - Invoke: merge-sweep --gate-attestation=<gate_token> (reuses Phase 3 token)

Phase 5: REPORT
  - Write org queue report to ~/.claude/pr-queue/<date>/report_<run_id>.md
  - Print report path; post to Slack if --slack-report
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--repos` | all | Comma-separated repo names to scan |
| `--skip-review` | false | Skip Phase 1 (review-all-prs); restores v0 behavior |
| `--skip-fix` | false | Skip Phase 2 (sweep-only mode) |
| `--dry-run` | false | Phase 0 only — print plan without executing any phase; includes re-run block with run_id and would-write paths |
| `--run-id` | none | Resume a previous run by run_id; skips phases already in phase_completed |
| `--authors` | all | Forwarded to all sub-skills. Recommended: `me` for first production run |
| `--max-total-prs` | 20 | Hard cap on PRs processed across all phases |
| `--max-total-merges` | 10 | Hard cap on merges across Phase 3 + Phase 4 |
| `--max-parallel-prs` | 5 | Concurrent agents (forwarded to sub-skills) |
| `--merge-method` | `squash` | `squash` \| `merge` \| `rebase` (forwarded to merge-sweep) |
| `--allow-force-push` | false | Forwarded to fix-prs |
| `--slack-report` | false | Post report summary to Slack after completion |
| `--max-parallel-repos` | 3 | Repos scanned in parallel (forwarded to sub-skills) |
| `--clean-runs` | 2 | Required consecutive clean passes; forwarded to review-all-prs |
| `--max-review-minutes` | 30 | Per-PR timeout; forwarded to review-all-prs |

**First production run recommendation**: use `--authors me --skip-review` to limit blast
radius and skip the review phase until it has been validated standalone.

## Run Ledger and Resume Semantics

Path constants are defined in `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md`: `RUNS_DIR`, `CLAIMS_DIR`.
The pipeline tracks per-run state in a ledger at `<RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/ledger.json`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "20260223-143012-a3f",
  "started_at": "2026-02-23T14:30:12Z",
  "phase_completed": ["scan", "review", "fix", "merge", "report"],
  "stop_reason": "completed",
  "inventory_path": "<RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/inventory.json"
}
```

### phase_completed Invariant

`phase_completed` is an ordered list that ONLY appends — it never regresses. Phases are appended in sequence:
`["scan"]` → `["scan", "review"]` → `["scan", "review", "fix"]` → `["scan", "review", "fix", "merge", "report"]`

### stop_reason Values

> **Disambiguation**: `stop_reason` (in `ledger.json`) and `status` (in `ModelSkillResult`) are
> **separate fields with different value sets**. `stop_reason` uses `completed`/`partial_completed`;
> `ModelSkillResult.status` uses `complete`/`partial`. Do not conflate them.
> Mapping: `status: "complete"` ↔ `stop_reason: "completed"` | `status: "partial"` ↔ `stop_reason: "partial_completed"`

Terminal stop reasons written to the ledger (`ledger.json.stop_reason`):

| stop_reason | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `completed` | All eligible phases ran successfully; at least one phase produced output |
| `partial_completed` | Pipeline stopped mid-run (e.g., 1 of 2 PRs processed); not all work done |
| `gate_rejected` | Human rejected the Phase 3 Slack gate |
| `nothing_to_do` | Phase 0 found no merge-ready or fixable PRs |
| `error` | Unrecoverable error prevented phase completion |

`partial_completed` is used when the pipeline completed some — but not all — eligible PRs before stopping. It is distinct from `completed`, which requires all eligible work to have been processed.

### Resume with --run-id

```bash
/pr-queue-pipeline --run-id 20260223-143012-a3f
```

When `--run-id` is provided:
1. Load ledger from `<RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/ledger.json` (see `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md` for `RUNS_DIR`)
2. Log: "Resuming from phase: <next_phase>" where next_phase is the first phase not in `phase_completed`
3. Skip all phases already listed in `phase_completed` — do NOT re-execute them
4. Resume from the first phase NOT in `phase_completed`

### --dry-run + --run-id is Read-Only

When both `--dry-run` and `--run-id` are provided:
- Print plan only (stdout)
- Do NOT update ledger mtime or any state files
- Do NOT emit heartbeat
- Zero mutations: no GitHub calls, no file writes

### Dry-Run Re-Run Block

`--dry-run` output always includes a re-run block:

```
Dry run complete. No phases executed.

Re-run command:
  /pr-queue-pipeline --run-id <run_id> [original-args]

Would write:
  <RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/ledger.json
  <RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/inventory.json
  ~/.claude/pr-queue/<date>/report_<run_id>.md
  ~/.claude/pr-queue/<date>/pipeline_<run_id>.json
```

(See `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md` for `RUNS_DIR` constant.)

## Inventory Plumbing

Path constants `RUNS_DIR` and `CLAIMS_DIR` are defined in `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md`.

Before any sub-skill (fix-prs, merge-sweep, review-all-prs) is invoked, the pipeline writes
an inventory file at `<RUNS_DIR>/<run_id>/inventory.json`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "<run_id>",
  "generated_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "merge_ready": [
    {"repo": "OmniNode-ai/omniclaude", "pr_number": 247, "head_sha": "cbca770e", "title": "..."}
  ],
  "needs_fix": [
    {"repo": "OmniNode-ai/omniintelligence", "pr_number": 34, "head_sha": "ff3ab12c", "reason": "conflict"}
  ]
}
```

Sub-skills receive the inventory path via `--inventory <path>`. This ensures sub-skills operate
on a consistent snapshot and do not re-scan independently.

**Invariant**: inventory.json is written BEFORE the first sub-skill is dispatched. Sub-skills
MUST receive `--inventory <path>` to consume the pre-built PR list.

## Claims Cleanup

Claims path management uses `CLAIMS_DIR` from `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md`.

During execution, the pipeline creates per-PR claim files at `<CLAIMS_DIR>/<run_id>/<repo>-<pr_number>.json`
to prevent concurrent pipeline runs from processing the same PR.

**Terminal run cleanup invariant**: When a run reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `gate_rejected`,
`nothing_to_do`, `error`), all claim files for this `run_id` under `CLAIMS_DIR` are removed.

After a terminal run, no claim files remain for the completed `run_id`.

`partial_completed` runs may leave claims if interrupted; use `--run-id` to resume and trigger cleanup.

## Gate Token Contract

```
Pipeline generates at start: run_id = "<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<random6>"

Phase 3 Slack gate returns: gate_message_ts (Slack thread timestamp)
gate_token = "<gate_message_ts>:<run_id>"

merge-sweep called with: --gate-attestation=<gate_token>
merge-sweep validates token format before proceeding (enforced by merge-sweep)
All merge results include gate_token for audit trail
```

## Slack Gate Message Format (v1)

```
PR Queue Pipeline — run <run_id>
Scope: <repos> | Authors: <authors or "all">

READY TO MERGE (N PRs):
  • OmniNode-ai/omniclaude#247 — feat: auto-detect (5 ✓, approved) SHA: cbca770e
  • OmniNode-ai/omnibase_core#88 — fix: validator (3 ✓, no review required) SHA: ff3ab12c

REVIEWED THIS RUN (Phase 1 applied local-review fixes):
  • OmniNode-ai/omnidash#19 — 2 iterations, 1 fix committed

REPAIRED THIS RUN (Phase 4 sweep picks these up if CI settles):
  • OmniNode-ai/omniintelligence#34 — fixed merge conflict + CI

Commands:
  approve all                    — merge all N ready PRs
  approve except omniclaude#247  — merge all except listed
  skip omniclaude#247            — exclude specific PR, merge rest
  reject                         — cancel merge phase

This is HIGH_RISK — silence will NOT auto-advance.
```

## ModelSkillResult

Written to `~/.claude/pr-queue/<date>/pipeline_<run_id>.json`:

```json
{
  "skill": "pr-queue-pipeline",
  "version": "0.2.0",

      "status": "all_clean | partial | nothing_to_review | skipped",
      "prs_reviewed": 8,
      "prs_fixed_and_pushed": 2
    },
    "fix_prs": {"status": "partial", "prs_fixed": 3, "prs_failed": 1, "skipped": false},
    "merge_sweep_phase3": {"status": "merged", "merged": 3},
    "merge_sweep_phase4": {"status": "merged", "merged": 2}
  },
  "total_prs_merged": 5,

  "total_prs_fixed": 3,
  "total_prs_still_blocked": 2,
  "total_prs_needs_human": 1,
  "total_prs_blocked_external": 1,
  "report_path": "~/.claude/pr-queue/2026-02-23/report_<run_id>.md"
}
```

Status values:
- `complete` — all work done, merges occurred
- `partial` — some phases completed, some had failures
- `nothing_to_do` — no merge-ready or fixable PRs found
- `gate_rejected` — human rejected the Slack gate
- `error` — unrecoverable error

## Phase Sequencing Invariant

**CRITICAL**: Phases run strictly sequentially. No phase starts until the previous completes.

```
Phase 1 (review-all-prs) → MUST COMPLETE (includes Phase 0 re-scan) → Phase 2 (fix-prs)
Phase 2 (fix-prs) → MUST COMPLETE → Phase 3 (gate+merge)
Phase 3 (merge) → MUST COMPLETE → Phase 4 (conditional merge)
Phase 4 (merge) → MUST COMPLETE → Phase 5 (report)
```

Note: "Phase 0 re-scan" is the final step of Phase 1 (not a separate phase). After
`review-all-prs` completes, the orchestrator re-runs the scan before handing off to Phase 2.

## Failure Handling

| Error | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Phase 0 scan fails | Return `status: error` |
| Phase 1 review-all-prs returns `error` | Log warning, continue to Phase 2 with pre-Phase-1 state |
| Phase 2 fix-prs returns `error` | Log warning, continue to Phase 3 with pre-Phase-2 merge_ready list |
| Phase 3 gate rejected | Return `status: gate_rejected`; write partial report |
| Phase 3 merge-sweep fails | Return `status: error` |
| Phase 4 condition not met | Skip Phase 4 silently |
| Phase 4 merge-sweep fails | Return `status: partial` (Phase 3 succeeded) |
| Report write fails | Log warning; return result (report is non-blocking) |

## Sub-skills Used

- `review-all-prs` (Phase 1) — runs local-review on all open PRs, pushes fix commits
- `fix-prs` (Phase 2) — autonomously repairs broken PRs (conflicts + CI + reviews)
- `merge-sweep` (Phase 3 + Phase 4) — merges approved PRs with gate bypass
- `slack-gate` (Phase 3, via merge-sweep) — HIGH_RISK gate for merge approval

## Org Queue Report Format

Written to `~/.claude/pr-queue/<date>/report_<run_id>.md`:

```markdown
# PR Queue Pipeline Report — <run_id>
Date: <date> | v1 | Scope: <repos> | Authors: <authors>

## Merged (<N> PRs)
- OmniNode-ai/omniclaude#247 — feat: auto-detect | squash | SHA: cbca770e

## Reviewed This Run (<N> PRs — Phase 1)
- OmniNode-ai/omnidash#19 — 2 iterations, fixed_and_pushed

## Fixed This Run (<N> PRs — Phase 2)
- OmniNode-ai/omniintelligence#34 — fixed merge conflict

## Still Blocked (<N> PRs)
- (none)

## Needs Human Review (<N> PRs)
- OmniNode-ai/omnidash#19 — retry_count: 3, no progress

## Blocked External (<N> PRs)
- OmniNode-ai/omnibase_core#55 — blocked_check: deploy-staging
```

## Integration Test

Test suite: `tests/integration/skills/pr_queue_pipeline/test_pr_queue_pipeline_integration.py`

All tests are static analysis / structural tests. No external credentials, live GitHub access, or
live PRs required. Safe for CI.

```bash
# 1. Dry-run output includes re-run block
#    → SKILL.md documents --dry-run emits run_id, would-write file paths, re-run command
#    → prompt.md documents dry-run prints re-run block before exit

# 2. Pipeline always writes inventory before calling sub-skills
#    → SKILL.md documents inventory.json written before sub-skill dispatch
#    → SKILL.md documents sub-skills receive --inventory <path> flag

# 3. phase_completed advances correctly
#    → SKILL.md documents phase_completed ordered list in ledger.json
#    → Expected sequence: ["scan", "review", "fix", "merge", "report"]

# 4. Resume skips completed phases
#    → SKILL.md documents --run-id flag for resume
#    → prompt.md documents "Resuming from phase: <next>" log message
#    → Skips phases already in phase_completed

# 5. stop_reason "partial_completed" vs "completed"
#    → SKILL.md documents both stop_reason values in terminal stop reason table
#    → partial_completed: some PRs processed, not all
#    → completed: all eligible work done

# 6. --dry-run + --run-id = read-only (no mutations, no heartbeat)
#    → SKILL.md documents --dry-run + --run-id combination is read-only
#    → No ledger mtime change, no heartbeat

# 7. No leftover claims after terminal run
#    → SKILL.md documents claims cleanup invariant for terminal runs
#    → no claim files remain for <run_id> under CLAIMS_DIR (see _lib/pr-safety/helpers.md)
```
