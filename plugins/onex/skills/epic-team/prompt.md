# Epic Team Orchestration

You are executing the epic-team skill as the **team-lead agent**. This document is the authoritative operational guide. Follow it exactly. Every phase transition, every state write, every guard check is mandatory.

## Argument Parsing

```
/epic-team {epic_id} [--resume] [--force] [--force-kill] [--force-unmatched] [--dry-run]
```

```python
args = "$ARGUMENTS".split()
if len(args) == 0:
    print("Error: epic_id is required. Usage: /epic-team OMN-1234")
    exit(1)
epic_id = args[0]

import re
if not re.match(r'^[A-Z]+-\d+$', epic_id):
    print(f"Error: Invalid epic_id format '{epic_id}'. Expected pattern like 'OMN-1234'.")
    exit(1)

resume       = "--resume"           in args
force        = "--force"            in args
force_kill   = "--force-kill"       in args
force_unmatched = "--force-unmatched" in args
dry_run      = "--dry-run"          in args

STATE_DIR  = f"~/.claude/epics/{epic_id}"
STATE_FILE = f"{STATE_DIR}/state.yaml"
REVOKED_FILE = f"{STATE_DIR}/revoked_runs.yaml"
```

## Execution Model: Direct Dispatch (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Workers spawned as team members do not sustain execution.** They go idle immediately after
spawning (`idleReason: available`) and never process tasks from the task queue. This is a
fundamental constraint of the current agent runtime.

The proven working pattern is **direct dispatch from the team-lead session**:

1. Group tickets into dependency-respecting waves (independent tickets in the same wave)
2. For each wave, dispatch one `Task()` per ticket in parallel
3. Await all Task() calls in the wave before starting the next wave
4. Collect results (status, pr_url) from each dispatched Task()

This replaces the WORKER_TEMPLATE / SendMessage / TaskList polling loop pattern entirely.

### Wave Construction

```python
def build_waves(assignments, cross_repo_splits):
    """Group tickets into waves based on cross-repo part dependencies.

    Wave 0: All non-split tickets + all Part 1 split tickets (no blockers).
    Wave 1: All Part 2 split tickets (blocked by Part 1 completion).
    Additional waves: any further dependency chains if present.

    Independent tickets within a wave are dispatched in parallel (same message).
    """
    split_part2_ids = {s["ticket_id"] for s in cross_repo_splits if s.get("part") == 2}

    wave0 = []   # no blockers
    wave1 = []   # blocked by wave0 (Part 2 cross-repo splits)

    for repo, ticket_ids in assignments.items():
        for ticket_id in ticket_ids:
            if ticket_id in split_part2_ids:
                wave1.append((repo, ticket_id))
            else:
                wave0.append((repo, ticket_id))

    waves = [w for w in [wave0, wave1] if w]
    return waves
```

### Task Dispatch Per Ticket

For each ticket in a wave, dispatch a Task() from the team-lead session:

```python
def dispatch_ticket(repo, ticket_id, ticket_title, ticket_url, repo_path, epic_id, run_id):
    """Dispatch ticket-pipeline for a single ticket as a Task() subagent."""
    result = Task(
        subagent_type="onex:polymorphic-agent",
        description=f"epic-team: run ticket-pipeline for {ticket_id} [{repo}]",
        prompt=f"""You are executing ticket {ticket_id} for epic {epic_id}.

Ticket: {ticket_id} - {ticket_title}
URL: {ticket_url}
Repo: {repo} at {repo_path}
Epic: {epic_id}  Run: {run_id}

Invoke: Skill(skill="onex:ticket-pipeline", args="{ticket_id}")

After ticket-pipeline completes, report back:
- ticket_id: {ticket_id}
- status: (merged/failed/blocked)
- pr_url: (if available)
- branch: (branch name used)
"""
    )
    return result
```

### Wave Execution Loop

```python
waves = build_waves(state["assignments"], state["cross_repo_splits"])
ticket_results = {}  # ticket_id -> {status, pr_url, branch}

for wave_idx, wave in enumerate(waves):
    print(f"\n=== Wave {wave_idx}: dispatching {len(wave)} ticket(s) ===")

    # Dispatch all tickets in this wave in parallel (single message = simultaneous Task calls)
    # The team-lead awaits all results before proceeding to the next wave.
    wave_results = [
        dispatch_ticket(repo, ticket_id, ...)
        for repo, ticket_id in wave
    ]

    # Collect results
    for result in wave_results:
        tid = result.get("ticket_id")
        ticket_results[tid] = {
            "status": result.get("status", "unknown"),
            "pr_url": result.get("pr_url"),
            "branch": result.get("branch"),
        }
        print(f"  {tid}: {ticket_results[tid]['status']}")

    # Persist results to state.yaml after each wave
    state["ticket_results"] = ticket_results
    write_yaml(STATE_FILE, state)

    # Optional: Slack notification per completed ticket
    for tid, res in {r.get("ticket_id"): r for r in wave_results}.items():
        try:
            if res.get("status") == "merged":
                notify_ticket_completed(ticket_id=tid, pr_url=res.get("pr_url"),
                                        slack_thread_ts=state.get("slack_thread_ts"))
            else:
                notify_ticket_failed(ticket_id=tid,
                                     slack_thread_ts=state.get("slack_thread_ts"))
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: Slack notification for {tid} failed (non-fatal): {e}")

print(f"\nAll {len(waves)} wave(s) complete.")
```

**DEPRECATED**: The WORKER_TEMPLATE, SendMessage/TaskList polling loop, and TeamCreate/TeamDelete
lifecycle are superseded by this direct dispatch pattern. They remain in the state schema for
historical reference but are no longer executed. See the deprecated section at the end of this
document if you need the old pattern for reference.

---

## Core Invariants

These rules are enforced at every step without exception.

### Phase Transition Rule

**Assert current phase → PERSIST new phase to state.yaml → Execute side effects.**

State.yaml is the ONLY write gate. Never execute side effects before persisting the new phase. If a side effect fails after the phase is persisted, the `--resume` path handles recovery.

### TaskList Filter (Triple Filter)

All TaskList calls use this base filter. Additional filters (owner, status) are ADDED to this base — never replacing it:

```python
BASE_FILTER = {
    "team_name": team_name,              # scoped to this team
    "description__contains": [
        f"[epic:{epic_id}]",             # scoped to this epic
        f"[run:{run_id}]",               # scoped to this run
    ]
}
# Example with additional filters:
WORKER_FILTER = {**BASE_FILTER, "owner": f"worker-{repo}", "status": "todo"}
```

### Termination Authority

**TaskList is the sole source of truth for task terminal status.** Worker SendMessage notifications are optional telemetry. A task is only terminal when TaskList confirms it. Notifications that arrive before TaskList confirms are logged and ignored for status decisions.

### TaskCreate Description Format (Canonical)

This exact format is used for all TaskCreate calls. It enables the triple filter and lease validation:

```
[epic:{epic_id}][run:{run_id}][repo:{repo}][lease:{run_id[:8]}:{repo}]{triage_tag}{part_tag} {title} — {url}
```

Where:
- `{triage_tag}` = `[triage:true]` for unmatched tickets, empty string otherwise
- `{part_tag}` = `[origin:{orig}][part:1-of-2]` for part 1 of a cross-repo split, `[part:2-of-2]` for part 2, empty string for non-split tickets
- `{title}` = ticket title from Linear
- `{url}` = Linear ticket URL

---

## `--resume` Path

Evaluated BEFORE any phase logic. If `--resume` is passed:

```python
# 1. Load state.yaml
state = load_yaml(STATE_FILE)
if state is None:
    print(f"ERROR: state.yaml not found at {STATE_FILE}. Cannot resume.")
    print("Run without --resume to start a new run.")
    exit(1)

# 2. If phase == "done": idempotent exit
if state["phase"] == "done":
    print_done_summary(state)
    print("Run is already complete. Use TeamDelete if you want to clean up resources.")
    exit(0)

# 3. Require both team_name and run_id
if not state.get("team_name") or not state.get("run_id"):
    print("ERROR: state.yaml is missing team_name or run_id.")
    print("State is unrecoverable. Use --force to start fresh.")
    exit(1)

team_name = state["team_name"]
run_id = state["run_id"]

# 4. Rebuild ticket_status_map from TaskList (authoritative)
tasks = TaskList(**BASE_FILTER)
ticket_status_map = {task.subject: task.status for task in tasks}

# 5. If all terminal: proceed directly to Phase 5
terminal = {"completed", "failed"}
if all(v in terminal for v in ticket_status_map.values()):
    goto Phase5()

# 6. Otherwise: print status table, enter monitoring loop
print_status_table(ticket_status_map)
goto Phase4_MonitoringLoop()
```

## Phase 1 — Intake

### Duplicate Guard

```python
def revoke_run(run_id):
    """Write run_id to revoked_runs.yaml. Workers check this on startup."""
    revoked = load_yaml(REVOKED_FILE) or {"revoked": []}
    if run_id not in revoked["revoked"]:
        revoked["revoked"].append(run_id)
    write_yaml(REVOKED_FILE, revoked)

def archive_state(path):
    import time
    ts = int(time.time())
    rename(path, f"{path}.bak.{ts}")
```

```python
state = load_yaml(STATE_FILE)  # None if not found

if state is not None:
    if state["phase"] != "done":
        # Active run exists
        if not force:
            print(f"ERROR: Active run {state['run_id']} exists (phase={state['phase']}).")
            print("Use --force to override, or --resume to continue.")
            exit(1)
        else:
            # --force: check for active workers
            tasks = TaskList(**BASE_FILTER, status="in_progress")
            active_tasks = [t for t in tasks]
            if active_tasks and not force_kill:
                print(f"ERROR: {len(active_tasks)} workers still active.")
                print("Use --force-kill to terminate active workers, or --resume to continue.")
                exit(1)
            # Revoke and archive
            revoke_run(state["run_id"])         # write revoked_runs.yaml
            TeamDelete(state["team_name"])       # best-effort, non-fatal
            archive_state(STATE_FILE)            # rename to state.yaml.bak.{timestamp}
    else:
        # phase == "done"
        if not force:
            print_done_summary(state)
            print("Run is already complete (idempotent). Use --force to re-run.")
            exit(0)
        # --force on done run: continue to start fresh (archive and proceed)
        archive_state(STATE_FILE)
```

                    pr_url=res.get("pr_url"),
                    slack_thread_ts=state.get("slack_thread_ts"),
                )
            else:
                notify_ticket_failed(
                    ticket_id=ticket_id,
                    slack_thread_ts=state.get("slack_thread_ts"),
                )

    # Persist results after each wave
    state["ticket_results"] = ticket_results
    write_yaml(STATE_FILE, state)

print(f"\nAll {len(waves)} wave(s) complete. {len(ticket_results)} ticket(s) processed.")
print("Phase 3 complete: all tickets dispatched. Proceeding to Phase 5.")
```

### Parallelism Rule

All Task() calls within a single wave MUST be dispatched in the same response (same message).
This ensures true parallelism — do NOT dispatch tickets sequentially within a wave.

### Wave Serialization Rule

Wave N+1 starts only after all Task() calls from Wave N have returned. Never dispatch Wave 1
before Wave 0 is fully complete, because Wave 1 (Part 2 cross-repo splits) depend on Wave 0
(Part 1) having created the target branch and initial implementation.

---

## Phase 4 — Done (Formerly "Monitoring")

> **Note**: Phase 4 (Monitoring) is no longer a polling loop. With the direct dispatch model,
> all tickets complete synchronously as Task() calls within Phase 3. Phase 4 is now a lightweight
> cleanup step that flows immediately from Phase 3.

```python
# Phase 4 is entered immediately after Phase 3 wave execution completes.
# No polling loop, no TaskList queries, no wait_for_event_or_timeout().
state = load_yaml(STATE_FILE)
state["phase"] = "monitoring"   # preserve state schema compatibility
write_yaml(STATE_FILE, state)
# AUTO-ADVANCE to Phase 5 immediately
goto Phase5()
```

---

## Phase 5 — Done

# PERSIST phase="done" and end_time FIRST — before any side effects

## DEPRECATED: Worker Prompt Template

> **DEPRECATED** — The WORKER_TEMPLATE is no longer used. Workers spawned as team members go
> idle immediately (`idleReason: available`) and never process tasks. The direct dispatch
> pattern in Phase 3 (wave-based Task() dispatch from the team-lead session) is the
> authoritative execution model. This template is preserved here for historical reference only.
>
> Do NOT use WORKER_TEMPLATE in new code. Do NOT spawn workers via TeamCreate + Task(team_name=...).

The following constant `WORKER_TEMPLATE` was embedded in the team-lead orchestration. It is preserved for reference only.

```python
WORKER_TEMPLATE = """
You are a worker agent for epic {epic_id}, assigned to repository {repo}.
Team: {team_name} | Run: {run_id}

## Startup Validation

Before claiming any task, perform these checks:

### 1. Path Check

Verify you are in a valid environment:

```python
import os
cwd = os.getcwd()
expected_markers = ["plugins/onex"]  # omniclaude repo root markers
if not any(os.path.isdir(os.path.join(cwd, m)) for m in expected_markers):
    print(f"ERROR: Worker path check failed. CWD={cwd}")
    print("Expected to be in omniclaude repo root.")
    exit(1)
```

### 2. Revocation Check

Check whether this run has been revoked:

```python
REVOKED_FILE = f"~/.claude/epics/{epic_id}/revoked_runs.yaml"
revoked_data = load_yaml(REVOKED_FILE) or {{"revoked": []}}
if "{run_id}" in revoked_data["revoked"]:
    print(f"Run {run_id} has been revoked. Exiting.")
    exit(0)
```

## Task Discovery

Use the triple filter to find tasks assigned to this worker:

```python
BASE_FILTER = {{
    "team_name": "{team_name}",
    "description__contains": [
        "[epic:{epic_id}]",
        "[run:{run_id}]",
    ]
}}
WORKER_FILTER = {{**BASE_FILTER, "owner": "worker-{repo}", "status": "todo"}}

tasks = TaskList(**WORKER_FILTER)
if not tasks:
    print("No tasks found for worker-{repo} in run {run_id}. Nothing to do.")
    SendMessage(
        to="team-lead",
        content={{
            "status": "idle",
            "repo": "{repo}",
            "message": "No tasks found. Worker exiting."
        }}
    )
    exit(0)
```

## Lease Token Verification

Before claiming a task, verify the lease token in the description:

```python
def verify_lease(task):
    expected_lease = f"[lease:{run_id_short}:{repo}]"
    if expected_lease not in task.description:
        print(f"WARNING: Task {{task.id}} lease mismatch. Expected {{expected_lease}}.")
        print(f"Description: {{task.description[:200]}}")
        return False
    return True
```

Where `run_id_short = "{run_id_short}"` (first 8 chars of run_id).

## Task Claim

For each task in `tasks`:

```python
for task in tasks:
    # Verify lease token
    if not verify_lease(task):
        print(f"Skipping task {{task.id}}: lease mismatch.")
        continue

    # Check for blocked tasks (cross-repo part 2)
    if task.status == "blocked":
        print(f"Task {{task.id}} is blocked. Skipping for now.")
        continue

    # Claim: update status to in_progress
    TaskUpdate(task_id=task.id, status="in_progress")

    # Re-fetch to confirm claim (verify status is in_progress and owner is us)
    claimed = TaskGet(task_id=task.id)
    if claimed.status != "in_progress" or claimed.owner != "worker-{repo}":
        print(f"Task {{task.id}} claim failed (race condition). Skipping.")
        continue

    # Notify team-lead of claim (telemetry)
    SendMessage(
        to="team-lead",
        content={{
            "event": "task_claimed",
            "task_id": task.id,
            "ticket_id": extract_ticket_id(task.description),
            "repo": "{repo}",
        }}
    )

    # Execute ticket work
    execute_ticket(task)
```

## Worktree Setup

For each ticket, create a git worktree at the canonical path:

```python
def setup_worktree(ticket_id):
    repo_path = f"../{repo}"
    worktree_root = f"{{repo_path}}/.claude/worktrees/{epic_id}/{run_id_short}/{{ticket_id}}"
    branch = f"epic/{epic_id}/{{ticket_id}}/{run_id_short}"

    # Create worktree
    import subprocess
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "-C", repo_path, "worktree", "add", "-b", branch,
         worktree_root, "origin/main"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Worktree creation failed: {{result.stderr}}")

    return worktree_root, branch
```

Canonical root path: `../{repo}/.claude/worktrees/{epic_id}/{run_id_short}/{{ticket_id}}`
Branch format: `epic/{epic_id}/{{ticket_id}}/{run_id_short}`

## Ticket Work Execution

```python
def execute_ticket(task):
    ticket_id = extract_ticket_id(task.description)
    is_triage = "[triage:true]" in task.description

    try:
        worktree_path, branch = setup_worktree(ticket_id)

        if is_triage:
            # Triage tickets: analyze and create sub-tickets, no implementation
            result = Skill("triage-ticket", args=ticket_id, cwd=worktree_path)
        else:
            # Normal ticket: invoke ticket-work skill
            result = Skill("ticket-work", args=ticket_id, cwd=worktree_path)

        # Extract PR URL if present in result
        pr_url = extract_pr_url(result)

        # SUCCESS: update task status BEFORE sending message
        TaskUpdate(task_id=task.id, status="completed")

        # Send success message (after status update)
        SendMessage(
            to="team-lead",
            content={{
                "event": "task_completed",
                "task_id": task.id,
                "ticket_id": ticket_id,
                "repo": "{repo}",
                "pr_url": pr_url,
                "worktree": worktree_path,
                "branch": branch,
            }}
        )

        # Inbox notification: broadcast to epic + directed to team-lead
        # (@_lib/agent-inbox/helpers.md)
        try:
            notify_task_completed(
                source_agent_id=f"worker-{repo}",
                target_agent_id="team-lead",
                epic_id="{epic_id}",
                payload={{
                    "ticket_id": ticket_id,
                    "pr_url": pr_url,
                    "commit_sha": get_head_sha(worktree_path),
                    "branch": branch,
                    "repo": "{repo}",
                }},
                run_id="{run_id}",
            )
        except Exception as inbox_err:
            print(f"Warning: Inbox notification failed (non-fatal): {{inbox_err}}")

    except Exception as e:
        # FAILURE: update task status BEFORE sending message
        TaskUpdate(task_id=task.id, status="failed")

        # Send failure message (after status update)
        SendMessage(
            to="team-lead",
            content={{
                "event": "task_failed",
                "task_id": task.id,
                "ticket_id": ticket_id,
                "repo": "{repo}",
                "error": str(e),
            }}
        )
```

**Ordering rule**: TaskUpdate (status=completed/failed) MUST happen BEFORE SendMessage. This ensures the team-lead's TaskList polling sees terminal status before processing any notification.

## Final Summary

After processing all tasks, send a final summary:

```python
completed_tasks = [t for t in all_processed if t.final_status == "completed"]
failed_tasks    = [t for t in all_processed if t.final_status == "failed"]

SendMessage(
    to="team-lead",
    content={{
        "event": "worker_done",
        "repo": "{repo}",
        "run_id": "{run_id}",
        "team_name": "{team_name}",
        "summary": {{
            "total":     len(all_processed),
            "completed": len(completed_tasks),
            "failed":    len(failed_tasks),
            "pr_urls":   {{t.ticket_id: t.pr_url for t in completed_tasks if t.pr_url}},
        }},
    }}
)
```

"""

# DEPRECATED: ticket_status_map was populated by TaskList polling in the old worker model.
# It is no longer written. Use ticket_results instead.
# ticket_status_map: {}  # no longer written
```

### `~/.claude/epics/{epic_id}/revoked_runs.yaml`

Workers check this file during startup validation. If their `run_id` appears here, they self-terminate immediately.

```yaml
revoked:
  - "uuid-of-run-1"    # Previously force-killed runs
  - "uuid-of-run-2"
```

**Write procedure**: Always read-merge-write (never overwrite). Append the new run_id to the existing list.

## Execution Checklist

Before marking any phase complete, verify:

- [ ] Phase asserted before executing logic
- [ ] New phase persisted to state.yaml BEFORE side effects
- [ ] Wave 0 tickets dispatched in parallel (all Task() calls in one message)
- [ ] Wave 1 only dispatched after Wave 0 results are collected
- [ ] ticket_results persisted to state.yaml after each wave
- [ ] slack_thread_ts never overwritten with None if currently non-None
- [ ] Slack notifications non-fatal everywhere
- [ ] Phase 5 summary uses ticket_results (not ticket_status_map)
- [ ] WORKER_TEMPLATE not used; no TeamCreate/worker spawning in new runs
