# Dispatch Worker

Compile a worker dispatch spec through `node_dispatch_worker` and spawn a background agent.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the dispatch-worker skill."

> **Autonomous execution**: No human confirmation gate. `--dry-run` is the only preview mechanism.

## Quick Start

```
# Inline YAML spec
/dispatch_worker "
name: pr-202-fix
team: daylight-0411
role: fixer
scope: Fix omnimarket#202 halt_conditions CodeRabbit findings
targets: [omnimarket#202, OMN-8375]
"

# From file
/dispatch_worker ~/docs/plans/workers/pr-202-fix.yaml

# Dry run (print compiled prompt, no spawn)
/dispatch_worker --dry-run "
name: vggp-designer
team: daylight-0411
role: designer
scope: Design VGGP inference pipeline
targets: [OMN-8400]
"
```
