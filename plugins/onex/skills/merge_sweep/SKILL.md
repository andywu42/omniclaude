# Merge Sweep

## Mode Declaration

**This skill operates in CLOSE-OUT mode only.**

Merge-sweep is not a build skill. It does not create new features, implement tickets, or modify
application logic. Its purpose is to drain the PR queue by enabling auto-merge on ready PRs and
polishing PRs with fixable blocking issues.

**First output line** must always be:
```
[merge-sweep] MODE: close-out | run: <run_id>
```

No tool calls, file reads, or bash commands may precede this output. Announce this line
immediately when the skill is invoked, before any scanning or classification.

**Pre-condition check**: Merge-sweep must not be invoked in a session that is actively running
epic-team (build mode). If the session has an active epic run (`$ONEX_STATE_DIR/epics/*/state.yaml`
with `status: monitoring`), emit a warning:
```
WARNING: Active epic run detected. Merge-sweep during active build may conflict with in-flight PRs.
Proceed? (default: yes — merge-sweep is safe to run concurrently)
```
Then proceed without waiting for input (this is a headless-compatible warning, not a gate).

## Headless Mode (Overnight Pipelines)

Use `scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh` for overnight/unattended runs. This wrapper handles
`claude -p` invocation with scoped `--allowedTools`, auth recovery, and structured result YAML.

```bash
# Full headless sweep
./scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh

# Limit repos
./scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh --repos omniclaude,omnibase_core

# Skip polish (fast, merge-only sweep)
./scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh --skip-polish

# Resume interrupted sweep (picks up from last checkpoint)
./scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh --resume

# Dry run (print without executing)
./scripts/cron-merge-sweep.sh --dry-run
```

### Auth Recovery [OMN-7256]

The headless wrapper detects GitHub auth failures (`HTTP 401`, `token expired`, etc.) in
`claude -p` output and automatically runs `gh auth refresh` before retrying. Circuit breaker:
max 2 auth refreshes per cycle — if both fail, the run aborts with exit code 2.

Auth recovery flow:
1. Pre-check: `gh auth status` before invoking claude. If it fails, refresh immediately.
2. During sweep: if merge-sweep output contains auth failure indicators, refresh and retry.
3. Circuit breaker: after 2 failed refreshes, abort and write `auth_failed` to result YAML.

### Result YAML

Each run produces a structured result at `.onex_state/merge-sweep-results/{run_id}.yaml`:

```yaml
run_id: "merge-sweep-2026-04-02T03-00-00Z"
completed_at: "2026-04-02T03:12:00Z"
status: "complete"        # complete | failed | auth_failed
attempts: 1
auth_refreshes: 0
sweep_args: "--skip-polish"
output_files:
  - "merge-sweep-2026-04-02T03-00-00Z-attempt-1.txt"
```

**Headless resume pattern**: When a headless sweep is interrupted (usage limit, rate limit,
process kill), the next cron invocation should use `--resume` to continue from the checkpoint.

**Minimum tool allowlist for headless merge-sweep:**
```
Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
```

**Failure doctrine in headless mode:**
- **Missing credentials** (`gh auth` not configured): exit 2 immediately, structured JSON to stderr
- **Ambiguity** (conflicting PR state, claim race): write
  `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/merge-sweep/ambiguity_<ts>.json`, exit 3 — never guess
- **Blocked tool** (not in allowlist): log denial, exit 4 — never silently substitute
- **Partial failure** (some repos failed): record in ModelSkillResult `details` array and
  continue remaining repos — partial completion is acceptable; exit 5 only if ALL repos fail
- **Slack notification failure**: log warning only — never fail the skill for notification issues

**Idempotency**: The claim registry and idempotency ledger in
`$ONEX_STATE_DIR/pr-queue/<date>/run_<run_id>.json` ensure safe re-runs. Re-running
merge-sweep with the same `--run-id` skips PRs already processed in the current run.

## Dispatch Surface: Agent Teams

merge-sweep uses Claude Code Agent Teams with two parallel worker tracks. The team lead (this
session) creates the team, runs Track A (merge) inline, and dispatches Track B (polish) workers
as background agents.

### Lifecycle

```
1. TeamCreate(team_name="merge-sweep-{run_id}")
2. Track A (inline): team lead scans repos, classifies PRs, enables auto-merge directly
3. Track B (parallel workers): for each PR in polish_queue:
   a. Agent(name="polish-{repo}-pr-{N}", team_name="merge-sweep-{run_id}",
            prompt="Execute pr-polish for PR #{N} in {repo}. --required-clean-runs {polish_clean_runs}")
4. Track B workers report completion via SendMessage(to="team-lead") with polish results
5. Team lead collects results from both tracks, builds ModelSkillResult
6. TeamDelete(team_name="merge-sweep-{run_id}") after all workers complete or time out
```

Track A runs inline because it is lightweight (API calls only — `gh pr merge --auto`).
Track B workers run in parallel up to `--max-parallel-polish` concurrent agents.

### Failure on Dispatch

If Agent Teams dispatch fails (TeamCreate error, Agent tool unavailable, auth error):
**STOP immediately.** Report the exact error to the user and wait for direction. Do NOT fall
back to direct Bash, Read, Edit, Write, or Glob calls — falling back bypasses observability,
context management, and the orchestration layer.

## Execution Rules

Execute end-to-end without stopping between tasks. If blocked on one task, record a skip note
and continue to the next. Only pause for: (a) credentials not available in the session,
(b) a destructive action not explicitly covered by the plan, or (c) an explicit user gate in
the plan. Do not exit plan mode or stop to "await direction" in any other circumstance.

## Overview

Composable skill that scans all repos in `omni_home` for open PRs and handles them in three tracks:

**Track A-update — Proactive Branch Updates**: PRs that are merge-ready but have stale branches
(`mergeStateStatus` BEHIND or UNKNOWN), or PRs where GitHub hasn't computed mergeable state
(`mergeable` UNKNOWN), get their branches updated via `gh api -X PUT .../update-branch`
BEFORE auto-merge is attempted. This prevents the chicken-and-egg deadlock where strict branch
protection requires branches to be current but auto-merge does not trigger updates. Updated PRs
are picked up on the next sweep pass after CI re-runs.

**Track A — GitHub Auto-Merge**: PRs that are already merge-ready with current branches get
`gh pr merge --auto` enabled immediately. GitHub merges them automatically when all required
checks pass — no polling, no waiting, no human gate required.

**Track B — Polish**: PRs with fixable blocking issues get dispatched to `pr-polish` in a
temporary worktree. pr-polish resolves conflicts, fixes CI failures, addresses review comments,
and runs a local-review loop. If a PR becomes merge-ready after polishing, auto-merge is
enabled on it too.

Designed as the daily close-out command — one sweep drains both the merge queue and the fix queue.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the merge-sweep skill."

> **Autonomous execution**: No Human Confirmation Gate. This skill runs end-to-end without
> human confirmation. After classification, proceed directly to Phase A and Phase B. Do not
> pause to ask the user. Do not include conditional or opt-out phrasing. `--dry-run` is the
> only preview mechanism; absence of `--dry-run` means "execute everything automatically."

## Quick Start

/merge-sweep --label ready-for-merge               # Only PRs with this label
/merge-sweep --label ready-for-merge,approved      # PRs with either label
/merge-sweep --since 2026-02-20 --label ready-for-merge  # Combine filters
/merge-sweep --max-parallel-polish 1               # Throttle pr-polish (lower resource use)
/merge-sweep --resume                              # Resume interrupted sweep from checkpoint
/merge-sweep --reset-state                         # Clear stale state and start fresh

**Classification order** (first match wins):
1. `needs_branch_update()` -- Track A-update (stale branch OR unknown mergeable state — update forces recomputation)
2. `is_merge_ready()` -- Track A (branch current, auto-merge immediately)
3. `needs_thread_resolution()` -- Track A-resolve (BLOCKED by unresolved conversations only)
4. `needs_polish()` -- Track B (fixable blocking issues)
5. Draft / `REVIEW_REQUIRED` / other BLOCKED -- skip silently

### Stacked PR Chain Detection (OMN-6458)

Before classifying a PR, check if it is part of a stacked chain:

```bash
# Get the PR's base branch
BASE=$(gh pr view {number} --json baseRefName -q '.baseRefName')

# If base is not main/master, this PR is stacked
if [[ "$BASE" != "main" && "$BASE" != "master" ]]; then
  # Find the base PR
  BASE_PR=$(gh pr list --head "$BASE" --json number -q '.[0].number')
  # Fix the base PR first — skip this PR until base is merged
  echo "STACKED: PR #{number} depends on PR #${BASE_PR} (base: ${BASE})"
fi
```

**Rules for stacked chains:**
1. Always fix the root PR first (the one targeting main)
2. Skip downstream PRs until their base is merged
3. Hard cap: warn if stack depth exceeds 3 — suggest collapsing

**Stack depth check:**
```bash
DEPTH=0; CURRENT_BASE="$BASE"
while [[ "$CURRENT_BASE" != "main" && "$CURRENT_BASE" != "master" && $DEPTH -lt 5 ]]; do
  DEPTH=$((DEPTH + 1))
  CURRENT_BASE=$(gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BASE" --json baseRefName -q '.[0].baseRefName' 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
done
if [[ $DEPTH -gt 3 ]]; then
  echo "::warning::Stack depth $DEPTH exceeds recommended max of 3"
fi
```

### Track A-rebase: DIRTY PRs (OMN-6459)

**Detection**: `gh pr view {number} --json mergeStateStatus -q '.mergeStateStatus'` returns `DIRTY`

**Action**:
1. Create worktree: `git worktree add /tmp/rebase-{number} {branch}`
2. Attempt rebase: `git rebase origin/main`
3. If rebase succeeds (no conflicts): force-push with lease: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. If rebase fails (conflicts): classify as Track B (needs manual polish)
5. Clean up worktree: `git worktree remove /tmp/rebase-{number}`

**Budget**: 1 rebase attempt per PR per cycle. If rebase fails, do not retry — route to Track B.

### Merge Queue Non-Interference (OMN-6468)

**NEVER** dequeue a PR from the merge queue. If a PR is in the merge queue (`mergeStateStatus: QUEUED`):
1. Do NOT run `gh pr merge --disable-auto-merge`
2. Do NOT dequeue and re-enqueue — this doubles CI time
3. Simply wait for the merge queue to process the PR
4. If the merge queue run fails, the PR will be dequeued automatically by GitHub

**Rationale**: Dequeuing and re-enqueuing creates a second CI run. The concurrency group has `cancel-in-progress: false`, so both runs execute sequentially, wasting ~10 min per unnecessary dequeue (F18).

| `--label` | all | Filter PRs with this label. Comma-separated = any match. |

## State Recovery & Checkpoint Protocol (OMN-7083)

merge-sweep writes per-repo progress to a state file after each repo completes. On re-invocation
with `--resume`, it reads the state file and skips already-processed repos/PRs. This prevents
lost progress when sweeps are interrupted by usage limits, rate limits, or context exhaustion.

### State File

Path: `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/merge-sweep/sweep-state.json`

```json
{
  "run_id": "20260331-084500-a3f",
  "started_at": "2026-03-31T08:45:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-31T09:12:33Z",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "repos": {
    "OmniNode-ai/omniclaude": {
      "status": "done",
      "prs_auto_merged": 3,
      "prs_polished": 1,
      "prs_branch_updated": 1,
      "prs_blocked": 0,
      "prs_failed": 0,
      "completed_at": "2026-03-31T08:52:11Z"
    },
    "OmniNode-ai/omnibase_core": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "prs_auto_merged": 1,
      "prs_polished": 0,
      "prs_branch_updated": 0,
      "prs_blocked": 0,
      "prs_failed": 0,

    },
    "OmniNode-ai/omnibase_infra": {

      "prs_polished": 0,
      "prs_branch_updated": 0,
      "prs_blocked": 0,
      "prs_failed": 0,
      "completed_at": null
    }
  },
  "backoff": {
    "consecutive_rate_limits": 0,
    "current_wait_seconds": 0,
    "last_rate_limit_at": null
  },
  "filters_snapshot": {
    "since": "2026-03-20",
    "labels": [],
    "authors": [],
    "repos_filter": []
  }
}
```

### Checkpoint Write Protocol

After completing ALL tracks (A-update, A, A-resolve, B) for a single repo:

1. Update `repos[repo].status` to `"done"` and set `completed_at`
2. Increment per-repo counters from the ModelSkillResult details for that repo
3. Update `updated_at` to current timestamp
4. Write the full state file atomically (write to `.tmp`, rename to final path)

If a repo fails mid-processing (rate limit, API error, etc.):

1. Set `repos[repo].status` to `"failed"` with partial counters
2. Write state file
3. Continue to next repo (existing partial-failure behavior)

### Resume Protocol (`--resume`)

On invocation with `--resume`:

1. Read `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/merge-sweep/sweep-state.json`
2. If file does not exist: proceed as normal (clean start), log info
3. If file exists:
   a. Validate `filters_snapshot` matches current invocation filters. If mismatch:
      log WARNING with the diff and proceed with current filters (the user may have
      intentionally changed filters). Do NOT abort.
   b. Skip repos where `repos[repo].status == "done"`
   c. Re-scan repos where status is `"in_progress"`, `"failed"`, or `"pending"`
   d. Inherit `run_id` from state file (ensures claim registry continuity)
   e. Inherit `backoff` state (resumes exponential backoff position)
4. Log resume summary:
   ```
   [merge-sweep] RESUMING run <run_id> from checkpoint
     Repos done (skipping):    5
     Repos pending/failed:     6 (will process)
     Backoff position:         0 consecutive rate limits
   ```

### Reset (`--reset-state`)

Delete the state file and start a clean run:
```bash
rm -f "$ONEX_STATE_DIR/merge-sweep/sweep-state.json"
```
Log: `[merge-sweep] State file cleared. Starting clean run.`

### Staleness Guard

If the state file's `started_at` is older than 24 hours, treat it as stale:
- Log WARNING: `State file is >24h old (started: <timestamp>). Starting fresh run.`
- Delete the state file and proceed as clean start
- Rationale: PR state changes rapidly; a day-old checkpoint is unreliable

### Exponential Backoff on Rate Limits

When a GitHub API call returns HTTP 429 or the `gh` CLI reports "rate limit exceeded":

```python
def handle_rate_limit(backoff_state: dict) -> int:
    """Returns seconds to wait before retry."""
    BASE_WAIT = 60
    MAX_WAIT = 900  # 15 minutes
    backoff_state["consecutive_rate_limits"] += 1
    backoff_state["last_rate_limit_at"] = now_iso()
    wait = min(BASE_WAIT * (2 ** (backoff_state["consecutive_rate_limits"] - 1)), MAX_WAIT)
    backoff_state["current_wait_seconds"] = wait
    return wait

def reset_backoff(backoff_state: dict):
    """Call after any successful API call."""
    backoff_state["consecutive_rate_limits"] = 0
    backoff_state["current_wait_seconds"] = 0
```

Backoff progression: 60s → 120s → 240s → 480s → 900s (cap).

After waiting, retry the failed operation once. If it fails again, write checkpoint and
skip to next repo. The next `--resume` invocation picks up where this one stopped.

**Integration with checkpoint**: Before sleeping for backoff, write the current state file.
This ensures that if the process is killed during the wait, progress is preserved.

## Execution Algorithm

```
0. STATE RECOVERY:
   IF --reset-state: delete state file, proceed to step 1
   IF --resume AND state file exists AND state file < 24h old:
     Load state file → resume_state
     Skip repos where resume_state.repos[repo].status == "done"
     Inherit run_id and backoff from resume_state
     Log resume summary (repos done / pending / failed)
   ELSE: initialize empty state with new run_id, write initial state file

1. VALIDATE: parse and validate --since date if provided

2. SCAN (parallel, up to --max-parallel-repos; SKIP repos marked "done" in resume_state):
   Initialize: repo_scan_results = {repo: None for repo in repo_list}
   For each repo:

     On success: repo_scan_results[repo] = prs (even if [])
     On failure: leave repo_scan_results[repo] = None

2a. POST-SCAN COVERAGE ASSERTION:
   After all parallel scans complete, assert every configured repo returned a result.
   repos_scanned = count of repos with non-None result
   repos_failed = count of repos where result is still None (silent miss)
   Log WARNING for each failed repo; include in ModelSkillResult as result: scan_failed
   Scan failures do NOT abort the run — successfully scanned repos are still processed.

3. CLASSIFY (apply all filters including --authors, --since, --label;
   first match wins per PR):
   - needs_branch_update() + passes filters → branch_update_queue[] (Track A-update; includes UNKNOWN mergeable PRs)
   - is_merge_ready() + passes filters → candidates[] (Track A)
   - needs_thread_resolution() + passes filters → thread_resolve_queue[] (Track A-resolve)
   - needs_polish() + passes filters → polish_queue[] (Track B)
   - draft / REVIEW_REQUIRED / else → ignore silently
   Check claim registry; exclude PRs with active claims from other runs.
   Apply --max-total-merges cap to candidates[] (skip if 0).

4. If branch_update_queue[], candidates[], thread_resolve_queue[], and polish_queue[] are all empty:
   → emit ModelSkillResult(status=nothing_to_merge), exit

5. If --dry-run:
   → print all queues (Track A-update, Track A, and Track B tables), exit

5a. PROCEED UNCONDITIONALLY to Phase A-update.
    DO NOT present classification results and wait for user input.
    --dry-run is the only preview mechanism. Without it, execute everything.

5b. PHASE A-update — Proactive branch updates (sequential):
    For each PR in branch_update_queue[]:
      check_merge_state(repo, N)  — via @_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md
      IF mergeable_state in ("behind", "unknown"):
        IF rebaseable:
          update_pr_branch(repo, N)  — via @_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md
          record as "branch_updated" (CI will re-run; next sweep handles merge)
        ELSE:
          log WARNING — may need Track B or manual resolution
      ELIF mergeable_state == "clean":
        promote to candidates[] (race: branch was updated between scan and execution)
    Sequential processing respects GitHub rate limits.

5c. PHASE A-resolve — Assess and resolve review threads (sequential):
    For each PR in thread_resolve_queue[]:
      resolve_review_threads(repo, N)  — via @_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md
      For each unresolved thread:
        1. Read comment body, file path, and line reference
        2. Read current file at referenced location (if it still exists)
        3. Classify disposition: addressed | not_applicable | intentional | deferred
        4. Post a reply explaining WHY the thread is being resolved (1-2 sentences)
        5. Resolve the thread
      After all threads resolved: promote to candidates[] for Phase A auto-merge
      Record as "threads_resolved" with disposition breakdown
    Sequential processing to avoid GitHub API rate limits on GraphQL mutations.

    CRITICAL: Never resolve a thread without posting a reply. Silent resolution
    defeats the purpose of code review.

6. PHASE A — Enable GitHub auto-merge (parallel, up to --max-parallel-prs):
   For each candidate in candidates[]:
     acquire claim
     gh pr merge <N> --repo <repo> --<merge_method> --auto
     IF fails with "Pull request is in clean status":
       gh pr merge <N> --repo <repo> --<merge_method>   (direct merge, no --auto)
       record result as "merged_directly"
     release claim

6a. POST-MERGE SAFETY — Update remaining BEHIND branches (sequential):
    Safety net for PRs that became BEHIND between scan and auto-merge (e.g.,
    another PR merged to main during this sweep). Most BEHIND detection now
    happens proactively in Step 5b.
    For each candidate where auto-merge was successfully enabled:
      check_merge_state(repo, N)
      IF mergeable_state == "behind" AND rebaseable:
        update_pr_branch(repo, N)

7. PHASE B — pr-polish queue (parallel Agent Teams workers, up to --max-parallel-polish):
   Skip if --skip-polish or polish_queue is empty.
   For each PR in polish_queue[]:
     acquire claim
     fetch headRefName from gh pr view (OMN-6253 defense — never trust scan-time branch name)
     dispatch Agent Teams worker:
       Agent(name="polish-{repo}-pr-{N}", team_name="merge-sweep-{run_id}",
             prompt="Execute pr-polish for PR #{N}:
               - create worktree at ${OMNI_WORKTREES}/merge-sweep-<run_id>/<repo>-pr-<N>/
               - Run pr-polish: Skill(skill='onex:pr_polish', args='<N> --required-clean-runs <polish_clean_runs>')
               - re-check mergeable state after polish
               - if now merge-ready: gh pr merge <N> --repo <repo> --<merge_method> --auto
                 (if 'Pull request is in clean status' error: retry without --auto as direct merge)
               - remove worktree
               - SendMessage(to='team-lead') with polish result")
     release claim

8. CHECKPOINT per repo: After all tracks complete for a repo, write checkpoint:
   state.repos[repo].status = "done"
   state.repos[repo].completed_at = now_iso()
   Increment per-repo counters from track results
   Write state file atomically (tmp + rename)

   ON RATE LIMIT at any API call (Steps 5b, 5c, 6, 7):
     wait_seconds = handle_rate_limit(state.backoff)
     Write checkpoint BEFORE sleeping (preserve progress if killed)
     Sleep wait_seconds
     Retry once; if still rate-limited: mark repo as "failed", write checkpoint, skip to next repo
     On success: reset_backoff(state.backoff)

9. COLLECT results (merge checkpoint data with in-memory results for ModelSkillResult)

10. SUMMARY: Post LOW_RISK informational notification to Slack (best-effort, no polling)
    Include resume stats if this was a --resume run:
    ```
    Resumed from checkpoint: <N> repos skipped (already done)
    ```

11. EMIT ModelSkillResult

12. FINALIZE STATE: Set state.status = "completed", write final state file.
    State file persists after completion for auditability. Cleared by --reset-state
    or automatically by the staleness guard on the next run (>24h).
```

## --since Date Filter

The `--since` flag filters PRs to only those updated after the given date:

```python
def parse_since(since_str: str) -> datetime:
    """Parse ISO 8601 date or datetime string."""
    for fmt in ("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S", "%Y-%m-%d"):
        try:
            dt = datetime.strptime(since_str, fmt)
            if dt.tzinfo is None:
                dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
            return dt
        except ValueError:
            continue
    raise ValueError(f"Cannot parse --since date: {since_str!r}. Use YYYY-MM-DD or ISO 8601.")
```

**Purpose**: Avoids sweeping ancient PRs with stale CI or forgotten review state.

## --label Filter

```python
def passes_label_filter(pr: dict, filter_labels: list[str]) -> bool:
    if not filter_labels:
        return True
    pr_labels = {label["name"] for label in pr.get("labels", [])}
    return bool(pr_labels & set(filter_labels))
```

## Sweep Summary (Slack Notification)

After both phases complete, post a LOW_RISK informational message to Slack.
No polling — notification only. Best-effort: if posting fails, log warning and continue.

```

## Failure Handling

| Error | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `gh pr list` returns no output / silent failure for a repo | Post-scan coverage assertion detects `None` in `repo_scan_results`; logs WARNING; records `result: scan_failed` in ModelSkillResult details; skips repo for this run |
| Repo scan dropped in async fan-out | Same as silent failure — detected by coverage assertion via `repo_scan_results[repo] == None` |
| PR `mergeable` state UNKNOWN | Route to Track A-update; branch update forces GitHub to recompute mergeable state. Next sweep handles the result. |
| PR `mergeStateStatus` BEHIND/UNKNOWN (scan) | Step 5b: update branch proactively; record `branch_updated`; CI re-runs; next sweep merges |
| PR becomes CLEAN between scan and Step 5b | Promote to `candidates[]` for normal auto-merge |
| PR is BEHIND but not rebaseable | Skip with warning; may need Track B or manual resolution |
| `update-branch` API fails (403/422) | Log warning, record `result: failed`, continue others |
| `update-branch` API returns 429 (rate limit) | Trigger exponential backoff; write checkpoint before sleeping; retry once after wait; if still 429, mark repo failed and skip |
| Any `gh` API call returns rate limit error | Same backoff protocol: checkpoint → sleep → retry once → skip on second failure |
| `gh pr list` fails for a repo | Log warning, skip that repo, continue others |
| Thread resolution GraphQL query fails | Log warning, record `result: failed` for that PR, continue others |
| Thread reply mutation fails | Log warning, still attempt to resolve the thread (resolution is priority) |
| Thread resolve mutation fails | Record in errors list, continue to next thread |
| All threads resolved but PR still BLOCKED | Log warning — may be non-thread branch protection issue; do NOT promote to Track A |
| `gh pr merge --auto` fails with "clean status" | Fall back to direct merge (no `--auto`); record `result: merged_directly` |
| `gh pr merge --auto` fails for other reasons | Record `result: failed`; continue others |
| PR becomes BEHIND after auto-merge armed (Step 6a) | Safety net: update branch post-merge |
| pr-polish BLOCKED (unresolvable conflicts) | Record `result: blocked`; skip auto-merge for that PR |
| pr-polish PARTIAL (max iterations hit) | Record `result: polished_partial`; skip auto-merge |
| Worktree creation fails | Record `result: failed`; release claim; continue others |
| Worktree cleanup fails | Log warning; do NOT fail skill result |
| Claim race condition | Record `result: failed, error: claim_race_condition` |
| `--since` parse error | Immediate error in Step 1; show format hint |
| Slack notification fails | Log warning only; do NOT fail skill result |
| Cascading BEHIND after branch update | Expected; subsequent sweeps handle remaining BEHIND PRs |
| `headRefName` API fetch fails at dispatch | Fall back to scan-time `headRefName` with WARNING; pr-polish Step 0 re-verifies independently |
| pr-polish branch mismatch detected | pr-polish auto-corrects via `git checkout`; if checkout fails, abort that PR with FATAL |
| Post-push SHA mismatch | WARNING logged — fixes may have been pushed to wrong branch; manual verification needed |

## Sub-skills Used

- `pr-polish` — three-phase PR fix workflow (conflict resolution + pr-review-dev + local-review loop)
- `pr-review-dev` — invoked by pr-polish for CI failures and review comments
- `local-review` — invoked by pr-polish for iterative clean-pass loop

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are in `tests/integration/skills/merge_sweep/test_merge_sweep_integration.py`.
Run with: `uv run pytest tests/integration/skills/merge_sweep/ -m unit -v`

**Note**: The test suite from v2.1.0 (OMN-2635) references `--gate-attestation` and `auto-merge`
sub-skill patterns that no longer apply in v3.0.0. Tests must be updated to verify:
- `gh pr merge --auto` in prompt.md (not `gh pr merge` directly)
- `pr-polish` sub-skill dispatch in prompt.md
- `needs_polish()` predicate documented in SKILL.md
- No `--gate-attestation` arg in either file
- `queued` status value in ModelSkillResult

## Changelog

- **v3.5.0** (OMN-7083): State recovery with per-repo checkpointing. Add `--resume` flag to
  continue interrupted sweeps from last checkpoint. Add `--reset-state` to clear stale state.
  State file at `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/merge-sweep/sweep-state.json` tracks per-repo completion
  status, counters, and backoff position. Exponential backoff on rate limits (60s base, 900s
  cap) with checkpoint-before-sleep to preserve progress if killed during wait. 24-hour
  staleness guard auto-clears old state files. Headless resume pattern documented for
  cron-closeout.sh integration. Fixes interrupted 11-repo sweeps losing all progress.
- **v3.4.0** (OMN-6253): Two-layer PR branch name defense. Dispatcher now fetches `headRefName`
  from `gh pr view` at dispatch time instead of trusting scan-time data. pr-polish agent
  independently verifies it is on the correct branch as Step 0 before any work begins. Post-push
  SHA verification confirms `headRefOid` matches local HEAD. Prevents the 2026-03-24 incident
  where all polish fixes were pushed to a non-PR branch for 4 cycles (~2 hours wasted).
- **v3.3.0** (OMN-5134): Intelligent review thread resolution. Add `needs_thread_resolution()`
  predicate for PRs that are MERGEABLE + BLOCKED + ALL_GREEN (blocked only by
  `required_conversation_resolution`). New Phase A-resolve assesses each unresolved thread
  against current code, posts a disposition reply (addressed | not_applicable | intentional |
  deferred), then resolves the thread. Promoted PRs flow into Phase A for auto-merge. Add
  `resolve_review_threads()` to `_lib/pr-safety/helpers.md`. Add `thread_resolve_queue_found`,
  `threads_resolved`, and `thread_resolve_dispositions` counters to ModelSkillResult. Also
  integrate thread resolution into pr-polish finalize phase. Replaces the previous
  BRANCH_PROTECTION_DRIFT warning (which required manual intervention) with automated handling.
  Fixes 9 PRs across 3 repos blocked on 2026-03-15 sweep.
- **v3.2.0** (OMN-4517): Post-scan repo coverage assertion. Distinguishes repos with zero PRs
  (confirmed empty scan) from repos that silently missed in the parallel fan-out. All configured
  repos are initialized to `None` before scanning; successful scans (even empty) set their entry
  to a list. After all parallel scans complete, a post-scan assertion logs `WARNING` and records
  `result: scan_failed` in `ModelSkillResult.details` for any repo still at `None`. Adds
  `repos_scanned` and `repos_failed` counters to `ModelSkillResult`. Sweep summary Slack message
  includes scan failure warnings when `repos_failed > 0`. Fixes observed silent misses of
  `omnimemory` (3 open PRs) and `omninode_infra` (1 open PR) on 2026-03-10.
- **v3.1.0** (OMN-3818): Proactive stale branch detection and update. Add `needs_branch_update()`
  predicate using `mergeStateStatus` field. PRs that are BEHIND or UNKNOWN get their branches
  updated BEFORE auto-merge is attempted (Step 5b), preventing the chicken-and-egg deadlock with
  strict branch protection. Add `branch_updated` result value, `branch_update_queue_found`,
  `branches_updated_proactive`, and `branches_updated_post_merge` counters to ModelSkillResult.
  Existing Step 6a retained as post-merge safety net. Add `mergeStateStatus` to scan fields.
- **v3.0.0**: Replace HIGH_RISK Slack gate with GitHub native auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto`).
  Add Track B: dispatch `pr-polish` on PRs with CI failures, conflicts, or changes-requested.
  PRs polished to merge-ready also get auto-merge enabled. Remove `--gate-attestation` and
  `--gate-timeout-minutes` (no longer needed). Add `--skip-polish`, `--max-parallel-polish`,
  `--polish-clean-runs`. Update ModelSkillResult status values and counters.
- **v2.1.0** (OMN-2633 + OMN-2635): Migrate legacy bypass flags to `--gate-attestation=<token>`.
  Add integration test suite.
- **v2.0.0** (OMN-2629): Add `--since` date filter, `--label` filter, reply polling,
  `--gate-timeout-minutes` override, post-sweep Slack summary.
- **v1.0.0** (OMN-2616): Initial implementation.

## Tier Routing (OMN-2828)

PR scanning uses tier-aware backend selection:

| Tier | Backend | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| `FULL_ONEX` | `node_git_effect.pr_list()` | Typed Pydantic models, structured output |
| `STANDALONE` | `_bin/pr-scan.sh` | Shell script wrapping `gh pr list` with consistent fields |
| `EVENT_BUS` | `_bin/pr-scan.sh` | Same as STANDALONE (no push-based PR list equivalent) |

Tier detection: see `@_lib/tier-routing/helpers.md`.

The scan output format is identical across all tiers -- downstream classification
(`needs_branch_update`, `is_merge_ready`, `needs_polish`) works unchanged regardless of backend.

## Idempotency Ledger

Absorbed from the former `fix-prs` skill. Per-run record at `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/pr-queue/<date>/run_<run_id>.json`:

```json
{
  "OmniNode-ai/omniclaude#247": {
    "head_sha": "cbca770e",
    "last_error_fingerprint": "SHA256(phase|error_class|check_name|first_error_line)",
    "last_result": "fixed",
    "retry_count": 1
  }
}
```

**Retry policy**: retry a PR only if `head_sha` changed OR `last_error_fingerprint` differs.
If `retry_count >= 3` and neither condition is met: skip with `result: needs_human`.

## CI Secrets Guard

Before invoking `ci-fix-pipeline` for any failing check in Track B, inspect the check name:

```
External infra indicators (skip ci-fix-pipeline for these checks):
  - Check name contains: deploy, production, prod, staging, aws, gcp, azure,
    service-account, docker-push, publish, release, upload-to

If the failing check matches any indicator:
  → record blocked_check = <check_name>
  → result = blocked_external for that check
  → do NOT invoke ci-fix-pipeline
  → continue to next check
```

If ALL failing checks are blocked_external: record PR as `result: blocked_external`, skip ci-fix-pipeline entirely.

## Retry Policy

Track B retry behavior for pr-polish failures:

- Retry only if `head_sha` changed OR `error_fingerprint` differs from last attempt
- Maximum 3 retries per PR per run
- After 3 retries with no progress: record `result: needs_human`
